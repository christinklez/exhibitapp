The aboriginal peoples who created this artwork have a very long history in the region. In North America, specifically in California and the surrounding region, archaeological evidence suggests that settlement began in the Paleoindian period (approximately 12,000-8,000 YBP, or \u201cyears before present\u201d), with the greatest use of the area occurring 2,600 to 1,000 YBP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is difficult to know when the sites in these particular images were created, because currently there are few techniques for dating rock art. Generally speaking, rock paintings in unprotected environments (like boulder faces) are thought to be less than 500 years old because they are exposed to wind and rain. But carved designs in hard rock like granite are durable and can last for thousands of years in a stable environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Meaning</h3>\r\n<p>Native American rock art provides us with many clues in our search for the history of California\u2019s aboriginal peoples. The painted or carved symbols are not writing, as we know it, but they were created to convey information. Their meanings are not always known, and are sometimes debated among scholars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rock art can range from simple scratch marks to elaborate motifs. Some common abstract design elements include circles, <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt129033c8/\">concentric circles</a>, spirals, dots, and <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt2q2nf147/\">meandering lines</a>. Representative designs include human forms and animals. Human forms with horns or <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt509nf2sw/\">radiating wavy lines</a> and animals such as the lizard and rattlesnake are thought to be symbols of power or spirit helpers. <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt8h4nf50n/\">This image</a> is thought to be a representation of a medicine bag, and <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt3s20355b/\">this one</a> clearly resembles a human hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ethnographic information has suggested that rock art served several functions. Some rock art styles could be boundary markers for clan territories or guides to water and food resources. Others, <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt3g5035g1/\">like this example</a>, may record historical events such as astronomical phenomena or the arrival of Spanish explorers. It has been determined that some rock paintings were made as part of girls\u2019 puberty ceremonies; designs most commonly thought to be related include <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt3p3037jb/\">red diamond chains and chevrons</a>. Some rock art motifs <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt5q2nf365/\">resemble the visionary imagery of trance states</a>, which Native American shamans entered to communicate with the spirit world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Types</h3>\r\n<p>Rock art is characterized by how it was created and the materials that comprise it. Major types include the following.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Petroglyphs</h4>\r\n<p><a href=\"/search/?q=petroglyph&repository_data=41\">Petroglyphs</a> are rock engravings produced by <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt8b69s213/\">pecking</a> (striking the surface of the rock with a harder small stone), <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt8h4nf50n/\">chiseling</a> (using a hammer stone to pound a sharp stone chisel), <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt5c603607/\">abraiding</a> (rubbing or battering the rock surface with a rounded stone), or <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt4q2nf1m3/\">scratching</a> (using a very sharp edged stone to scratch finer lines).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cDesert varnish,\u201d a reddish brown or black mineral patina that forms on rock surfaces in the desert, creates a perfect medium for petroglyphs. Designs such as <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt5z09r8zh/\">this one</a> were etched through the patina to reveal the lighter rock beneath. Desert varnish forms very slowly\u20141,000 years for a heavy varnish\u2014and becomes thicker and darker with increasing age.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Cupules</h4>\r\n<p><a href=\"/search/?q=cupule&repository_data=41\">Cupules</a>, a type of petroglyph, are small, cup-shaped indentations. They are pecked or ground into the stone and appear randomly or sometimes in lines or groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Pictographs</h4>\r\n<p><a href=\"/search/?q=pictograph&repository_data=41\">Pictographs</a> are designs painted on rock surfaces with paints made from natural mineral pigments mixed with animal fats, egg whites, plant oils, or urine to bind them. Hematite (iron oxide) was used for red paints, limonite for yellow, kaolin clays for white, and charcoal for black. Paints were applied with brushes made from yucca fiber or applied with fingers and hands. The most common color in southern California is red.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Geoglyphs (Intaglios)</h4>\r\n<p><a href=\"/search/?q=intaglio&repository_data=41\">Geoglyphs</a>, also known as intaglios, are giant drawings on the ground that depict geometric designs, human forms, and animal figures. These large designs were created by clearing the dark rock of desert pavements and exposing the lighter colored rock and sand below. Many of these figures were made over the last 2,000 years. More than 200 geoglyphs have been discovered along the Colorado River, and many others have been reported around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Natural Deterioration</h3>\r\n<p>Natural elements such as rain, wind, heat, and cold have had their effect on Native American rock art. Pigments have worn away and mineralization has re-patinated surfaces, rendering the images ever fainter. Heat and cold have caused crumbling and exfoliation while falling rocks have broken away designs from their original locations. Plants taking root in cracks, lichen growth, and mosses covering surfaces eventually break down rock and its images. <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt6c60379p/\">This image</a> shows a rock\u2014and, as a result, a design\u2014that has broken apart due to natural deterioration. Nevertheless, it is remarkable how well many of the symbols and designs made thousands of years ago have survived.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Vandalism and Destruction</h3>\r\n<p>While the effects of nature on rock art images are sad to see and result in great cultural loss, nothing is as devastating as the damage done by humans. This destruction takes many forms; sometimes it is inadvertent but often it is intentional. Many images have survived wind, rain, and storms for thousands of years only to fall victim to vandalism. For example, <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt158033rm/\">graffiti</a> and <a href=\"/item/ark:/13030/kt1m3nf13r/\">bullet holes</a> obfuscate and can potentially destroy a design. Because they are located on large swaths of ground, geoglyphs have also been negatively impacted by illegal motorcycles, SUVs, and off-highway vehicle activities.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "0dc8a4b94049e0a625ba392154b9c7d3", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt5c603607", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Native Americans: The 19th Century", "slug": "native-americans-19th-century", "short_title": "The 19th Century", "blockquote": "In the 19th century, native Californians struggled to preserve traditional ways--and their lives--in the face of disease, displacement, and violence.", "byline": "\"Native Americans: The 19th Century\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005 as part of the <a href=\"/cal-cultures\">California Cultures</a> project.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "###The Mission System and Spanish Rule\r\nBy 1823, Spaniards had founded 21 missions from San Diego to Sonoma. The mission system was Spain's centuries-old method of advancing and securing its colonial frontiers. Spain used natives to colonize new lands and provide a labor force to sustain its colonies. Two lithographs show European impressions of native Californian dancers in missions in San Francisco and San Jose.\r\n\r\nThe mission padres used force to obtain converts and labor. For example, the Spanish friars would allow Native Americans to escape or \"visit\" their homes, with the intention of following them and capturing other indigenous people. Motivated by curiosity and self-interest, many native Californians joined Spanish missions and villages, only to discover they were not permitted to leave.\r\n\r\nNative Americans were pressed into labor, working all day, serving as farm labor and domestic servants. The lithograph *Vue du Presidio de San Francisco* shows native people doing work under the supervision of Spaniards in the Presidio of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nNative women were often raped by Spanish soldiers and other settlers. The natives were severely disciplined for not working, but most often for attempting escape.\r\n\r\n### Life on the Ranchos\r\n\r\nSecularization began in 1834, with half of all mission lands to be turned over to local native groups. But native Californians were often never told that they owned land, and many drifted away, strangers in their own ancestral homelands.\r\n\r\nNative Californians provided most of the labor for the emergent Spanish ranching economy. Some worked as *vaqueros* herding cattle. The lithograph *California Vaqueros, Home from the Chase* pictures these is Spanish cowboys, some of whom may be of natives. Others processed tallow in huge iron pots, tended gardens, and harvested crops.\r\n\r\nLaborers were bound to their ranches in a state of perpetual peonage, with difficult working conditions and few alternatives. In response, some natives fled inland, joining mountain or desert groups and using their ranching knowledge to organize raids on livestock.\r\n\r\nDisplacement and depopulation contributed to an intense process of what anthropologists call \u201cethnogenesis,\u201d the creation of new ethnicities and identities. Native groups combined, split apart, and recombined in new ways in response to perilous times. Spanish-speaking natives intermarried with working-class Mexicans, further blurring racial categories.\r\n\r\n### The Gold Rush Era and Beyond\r\n\r\nThe Gold Rush further devastated California's native groups. The state's native population dropped from about 150,000 in 1848 to 30,000 just 12 years later. Miners and other newcomers methodically mined, hunted, and logged native groups' most remote hiding places. The print *A Road Scene in California* depicts European American miners moving into an area, as a native group walks the other direction. The photograph of a \"mining scene with flume and miners\" seems to show an Indian in the foreground.\r\n\r\nAlthough the lithograph of \"California gold diggers\" shows Indians and white miners coexisting, these were not peaceful times. In response to the invasion of their territory, natives began raiding mining camps for subsistence. American miners \u2014 supported by the state government \u2014 organized war parties and sometimes slaughtered entire native groups.\r\n\r\nEven as the native populations dwindled, paintings such as Carl Wimar's *Indian Campfire* continued to idealize a life that had almost disappeared. Photographs from this time, such as \"Group of Digger Indian Squaws,\" \"Washoe Indians \u2014 Valley of Lake Tahoe,\" and \"Washoe Indians \u2014 The Chief\u2019s Family,\" show Indians in Western dress, their traditional way of life disrupted.\r\n\r\nThe Act for the Government and Protection of Indians was passed by the state legislature in 1850. It denied native Californians the right to testify in court and allowed white Americans and Californios to keep natives as indentured servants. According to the National Park Service, an 1862 issue of the *Alta California* reported: \"Little more than a hundred miles from San Francisco, in Mendocino County, the practice of Indian stealing is still extensively carried out. Only recently, George H. Woodman was caught near Ukiah with sixteen Indian children, as he was about to take them out of the county for sale.\"\r\n\r\n### The Late 19th Century\r\n\"I do not like the white man because he is a liar and a thief,\" Isidora Filomena de Solano, a Patwin-speaking woman from the Bay Area, told an interviewer in 1874. She echoed the sentiments of many native Californians struggling to preserve traditional ways in the midst of holocaust. Indeed, under American rule Native Americans basically had no legal recourse to fight discrimination or the dispossession of their lands.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1870s, two significant events occurred. One was the Ghost Dance movement, which sought to restore native traditions. The other was the Modoc War of 1872-73, a series of battles between US soldiers and Modoc Indians near Tule Lake. These hard fought battles, which the Modoc eventually lost, were the last known time Indians in California resisted government authorities. The US Army asked photographer Eadward Muybridge to document the wars. His stereoscopic views purport to show both sides of the battle: \"A Modoc Brave on the Warpath\" on the native side, and \"Warm Spring Indian Scouts on Picket Duty\" under the Army's command.\r\n\r\nSome native people, such as the \"Indian Family at Santa Rosa Rancheria near Lemoor,\" shown here, lived in *rancherias* \u2014 a word that originally meant the workers' quarters on a rancho, and later came to refer to Indian settlements that were less formal than reservations. The print *Yosemite Rancheria* shows one such community of Indians camped near a river in 1878, six years after Yosemite had become a national park. Many rancherias still exist in California today.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the 19th century, the native Californian population had dropped to less than 20,000 as a result of disease, malnourishment, and violence. Less than half lived on reservations \u2014 most found work in California cities or in migratory agriculture (many found seasonal work in Southern California\u2019s wine industry.) There were few jobs open in the cities, and Native Americans often were not paid honestly. The cover of an 1895 issue of *The Wasp*, a satirical magazine of the time, illustrates some attitudes towards \"Uncle Sam's Indian Policy,\" which the magazine's editors considered ineffectual.", "render_as": "M", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "2d5b106a1bd39f1714af038d67f4d84a", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt5s20178k", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 3, "fields": {"title": "Native Americans: Pre-Columbian California to 18th Century", "slug": "native-americans-pre-columbian", "short_title": "Pre-Columbian California to 18th Century", "blockquote": "More than 200 different native tribes \u2014 about 300,000 people \u2014 once made up the population of the land that is today the state of California.", "byline": "\"Native Americans: Pre-Columbian California to 18th Century\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005 as part of the <a href=\"/cal-cultures\">California Cultures</a> project.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "### Where They Lived\r\n\r\nDiverse in culture and way of life, they lived in hundreds of small, politically autonomous communities up and down the state, connected by trade and kinship networks. Two maps show the general range of these tribes throughout the entire area. The map of Pomo linguistic stock shows many dialect variations and village sites, demonstrating the complexity of language variations in just one tribal group.\r\n\r\n### How They Lived\r\n\r\nMost California native communities consisted of between 200 and 500 people. Boundaries were general. Nomadic groups tended to have greater social and gender equality, while more sedentary groups had hierarchical social classes with a wide gulf between rich and poor.\r\n\r\nAlthough artwork by European artists depicts some aspects of California Indian life, we have no images from pre-Columbian California. The lithographs shown here, by Russian artist Ludwig Choris, were based on sketches he created during a visit to California in 1816 \u2014 long after their traditional way of life had been disrupted.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to get glimpses of their lives, but it is impossible to know how these tribes really looked and lived, as opposed to how they were viewed through European eyes. For example, because native groups usually altered the landscape in a way that mimicked nature, Europeans mistakenly assumed natives lived in an untouched \"wilderness.\" But whether they lived in mountains, valleys, deserts, forests, or beaches, native peoples continually managed their environment, tending and cultivating the land through controlled burnings, weeding, pruning, tilling, irrigation, and selective replanting.\r\n\r\n### Basketry\r\n\r\nWe do know that elaborate basketry was an integral component of Native Californian culture and subsistence. Baskets were both beautiful and functional. They varied greatly by shape and size based on their function, be it for gathering food, sifting acorn meal, storing tobacco, gambling, cooking, and even transporting water. Native Californians could weave so tightly that their baskets held boiling water \u2014 heated by hot rocks \u2014 without leaking.\r\n\r\nAlthough the images shown here do not include baskets from pre-Columbian times, these traditional baskets suggest the wide range of shapes, patterns, and types of baskets made by native women. Two photographs taken in Yosemite National Park during the 1930s and 1940s show Lucy Telles, a famous basketmaker also known as Pa-ma-has (1885-1955). Telles was of Yosemite Miwok and Mono Lake Paiute descent. She often worked in the park, demonstrating native basket-making techniques for tourists. One photograph shows her working on her largest basket; the other shows her seated amidst 10 other baskets, possibly all made by her.", "render_as": "M", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "8fcbb9cfee49a13b709063e55f68ea65", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/tf3m3nb5ht", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "Native Americans: The 20th Century and Today", "slug": "native-americans-20th-century-today", "short_title": "The 20th Century and Today", "blockquote": "Throughout the 20th Century, Native Californias fought for opportunities and rights, as part of a nationwide social justice movement that continues today.", "byline": "\"Native Americans: The 20th Century and Today\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005 as part of the <a href=\"/cal-cultures\">California Cultures</a> project.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "###Adaptation and Tradition\r\nAfter the low point of 1900, California's Indian population slowly began to increase as native communities adapted old ways to new circumstances. The number of Native Americans living in California rose steadily after 1900, reversing the appalling decline of the previous century. It is important to note that much of this increase was a result of relocation programs that encouraged Indians from other states to move to California.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 20th century, reformers struggled to raise public awareness of Indian poverty and to dispel myths of the permanently \"vanishing Indian.\" Native Americans were forced to make difficult choices about how to best maintain traditional ways to survive.\r\n\r\nThe anonymous families in the 1902 and 1903 photographs; the image of Chief Chepah and his wife, son, and daughter-in-law; the schoolgirls in the 1907 photographs; and the children at the Mission San Diego del Alcala school all illustrate this assimilation. The images \"Yuki Indian head\" and \"Captain John,\" and the photographs of various groups of Indian dancers, illustrate a pull in the opposite direction: to maintain traditions.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1910s, a native man named Ishi \u2014 believed to be the last survivor of his group, the Yahi \u2014 allowed University of California anthropologist A. L. Kroeber and others to study and interview him. During this time, Ishi lived with Kroeber and his family, and his obvious resiliency and intelligence challenged popular racist stereotypes. Photographs show Ishi in a variety of ways: dressed in a Western suit, seated in a chair; skinning the head of a deer in a traditional way; meeting other Indians; and flaking an arrow point. He also posed with Kroeber and Sam Batwi, a Northern/Central Yana Indian who served as an interpreter.\r\n\r\nThe early 20th century also saw Native Californians employing the legal system to fight for land rights, educational opportunities, and citizenship rights. In 1917, the California Supreme Court awarded Native Californians the right to vote, paving the way for the 1924 Indian Citizenship Act granting full citizenship.\r\n\r\n###Social Change and Self Determination\r\nBy the mid 1960s due to the influx of native americans through relocation from other states, there was a significant increase in indian urban populations. Those who did comprised California\u2019s most disadvantaged group, with higher unemployment rates than any other minority. Urban Indians fared better but still experienced limited educational and employment opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe 1960s and 70s were years of social change for many groups. Beginning in the 1960s, Native Americans in California formed pan-Indian organizations such as the American Indian Historical Society, California Rural Indian Health Board, and California Indian Education Association to advocate for native rights. A group of activists called Indians of All Tribes occupied Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay from 1969 to 1971, part of a nationwide Native American social justice movement that continues today. One photograph from this era shows demonstrators marching against anti-Indian legislation. The anonymous poster *The Longest Walk* and Manuel Diaz's *200 Years of Misery* illustrate the sentiments of these groups.\r\n\r\nThe American Indian Movement (AIM) was established with the goal of pushing the US government to redress the loss of lands and the breaking of several treaties. AIM also called for the recognition and protection of indigenous culture and religions and the affirmation of health, housing, employment, economic development, and educational opportunities for Native Americans.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1980s, the Cabazon and Morongo Bands of Mission Indians began offering card games and bingo on their reservations, setting off a controversy over gaming that would culminate in a 1987 US Supreme Court decision affirming Native Americans' right to build casinos on reservation lands. By 2005, there were 55 Native American casinos in California bringing tribes a total annual income of more than $3.5 billion.\r\n\r\nThese revenues have dramatically changed the economic, political, and social landscapes of California's native peoples. Because only groups that have been federally recognized as official tribes can build casinos, an enormous financial gulf now separates recognized and unrecognized native groups. Those groups with federal recognition enjoy considerable political clout, while members of unrecognized groups continue to suffer from joblessness, under-education, and poor living conditions. Money from gaming has also generated controversies over Indian identity as federally recognized groups have been forced to reconsider who can and cannot claim membership. Gaming has brought new wealth to some of California's Native Americans, but it has also brought new divisions, contentions, and self-definitions.", "render_as": "M", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "a52704dabe4acf15bd0110063e99f6f5", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/tf3x0nb4w0", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 5, "fields": {"title": "Native Americans: Arts and Traditions in Everyday Life", "slug": "native-americans-arts-and-traditions", "short_title": "Arts and Traditions in Everyday Life", "blockquote": "In the early 20th century, anthropologists documented and exalted Native American traditions.

Over time, native groups combined, split apart, and recombined in new ways, and individuals were assimilated first into the Spanish culture and later into mainstream American life. After 1900, the number of Native Americans living in California rose steadily as Indians from other states moved to the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Native Californian cultures changed, hundreds of languages and countless traditions were lost. Some traditional practices and arts, however, continued. As the 20th century began, these became valuable bits of knowledge for anthropologists to document, preserve, and study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the photographs in this topic were taken by anthropologists in the course of their fieldwork. They documented string games like cat\u2019s cradle (part of folk culture in many parts of the world), ceremonial dances, and the names and faces of the people they encountered. They also documented domestic activities such as basket weaving, including the gathering and preparing of fibers, as depicted in several images. One woman is shown cleaning pine nuts in a woven basket; other women use mortars to prepare food. Beginning and end of life were recorded: a woman stands holding a baby in basket, and a group is shown participating in a cremation ceremony in a field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the <a href=\"/exhibitions/t4/closing-american-frontier-1870-1900/\">closing of the frontier</a>, Americans grew nostalgic for remnants of the disappearing West \u2014 including the \u201cnoble savage.\u201d Anthropologists tended to be less interested in the contemporary lives of the people they were studying than in tradition, so these images portray surviving practices drawn from life before European exploration and colonization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other photographs in this topic, however, show Native Americans dressed for daily life in the new century. The unidentified men, women, and children photographed standing in a field in Alturas; the group of Northern California Yurok, cleaning surf fish in 1928; the families at Tule Lake and Hat Creek; and the two young women whose picture was taken at a fishing camp in 1928 all contrast with the idealized version of California\u2019s Native Americans that appealed to tourists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cGetting back to nature\u201d was a popular leisure activity in the early 20th century, and tourists enjoyed visiting rustic camps and the new national parks. There, the sale of handmade Native American mementos, and the showcasing of native traditional arts and ceremonies, helped some native peoples survive hard financial times. Tourists, eager to bring home authentic souvenirs, bought handmade baskets, such as those being sold by the unidentified Tallac woman near Lake Tahoe. For many years tourists in Yosemite National Park enjoyed demonstrations of tradition-based crafts and arts, such as basket-weaving and ceremonial dances (such as the one pictured here presented by Chris Brown, also known as Chief Lemee, behind the Yosemite Museum in 1950).</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "d1fcb23d32277e8e01400ae819d2f8a3", "lockup_derivative": "752d1f446524b96024eb04a905ad6edd", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/tf809nb96q", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 6, "fields": {"title": "Californio Society", "slug": "californio-society", "short_title": "Californio Society", "blockquote": "Californios, elite families that received large land grants from Spain and Mexico, flourished during the 1830s to 1880s.

Photographs of the Ramona Pageant from the 1950s testify to the mythologizing of California's Mexican and Spanish pastoral heritage less than 100 years later.\r\n\r\n<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The wealthy Spanish Californian families called <a href=\"/exhibitions/63/hispanic-americans-spanish-colonization-and-californios-1769-1800s/\">Californios</a> were the first group to receive large-scale benefit from California\u2019s rich agricultural resources. Many were given land grants from Spain. After 1821, other families received land title from the newly independent Mexico to encourage settlement in what was known as Alta California.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Californio wealth was closely tied to their land holdings and provided credit at local markets. Californios cultivated orchards and crops, but large-scale cattle ranching on large ranchos was key to their wealth. As the paintings show, even small-scale Native American and Mexican rancherias contributed to the management of cattle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly all aspects of Californio society were connected to its relationship to the land. This is reflected in dise\u00f1os, hand-drawn maps, which mark the natural geography of the land. Dise\u00f1o del Cayuma includes sketches of trees and waterways and provides a key in the lower left corner explaining details of the land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the <a href=\"/exhibitions/t3/gold-rush-era-1848-1865/\">Gold Rush</a>, and the end of the US-Mexican war in 1848, a massive influx of settlers laid claim to Californio land. Californios were forced to prove their land title in court, incurring large legal fees.</p><p>Under the US legal system, official surveyor maps replaced imprecise dise\u00f1os as legitimate markers of land ownership. The official 1884-85 surveyor map of Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Bernardino counties charts the grids of land with straight lines and careful measurement. Court cases often took over a decade to settle. Many Californio families were forced to sell off their land piece by piece in order to pay mounting legal fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As <a href=\"/exhibitions/18/the-transcontinental-railroad/\">transcontinental rail transportation</a> moved westward, railroads pressed the US government for large land grants. Californios\u2019 holdings grew smaller, as the official map of land granted to the railroads by 1875 makes clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Californios depended on labor supplied by Native Americans and Mexicans. In exchange, they would provide shelter and lodging, further intertwining laborers to the land and patriarchal relationships. The photograph of Indian \u201cJohn\u201d and his family at the Santa Rosa Rancheria highlights the identification of this Native American family to the rancho. In contrast, Californios such as Julia, wife of Joaquin Bolado, and Juan Ignacia Cantua are photographed in studio portraits as individuals. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Towards the end of the 19th century, immigrants from around the world were flooding into California. Many Californios married American and European settlers to secure their land and class status. The stately portrait of Dona Ramona Carillo de Pacheco de Wilson is a good example. Her title, Dona, and her elegant attire denote her elite Californio heritage. Her marriage to a Scottish settler and US military official would continue to secure her status in the early years of American control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the 19th century came to a close, Californios found their political clout vastly reduced and their past already becoming mythologized. Helen Hunt Jackson\u2019s 1884 novel Ramona told the tragic story of a Californio orphan girl who married an Indian. Written to create sympathy for the <a href=\"/exhibitions/2/native-americans-19th-century/\">plight of native Californians</a>, it was instead received as the portrait of an idyllic past. This romanticized vision persisted well into the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1950s-era photos of light-skinned actors in the popular Ramona Pageant illustrate contemporary racial biases rather than the cultural reality of early Californio society. During this period, the <a href=\"/exhibitions/36/the-bracero-program/\">Bracero Program</a> was in full force. Increased border regulations and immigration concerns began to separate California\u2019s future from its Mexican past. Commercialized tourism surrounding the Ramona myth, shown here in the photographs of the curio room at Ramona's marriage place (which never existed), reinforced the curiosity of modern Californians about its Spanish pastoral past. \r\nToday, descendants of Californio families still live in the state, and their names\u2014Sepuvelda, Yorba, Pico, Vallejo, Peralta\u2014mark the streets and towns of modern California. Californio society, however, is gone forever.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic0a.html", "hero": "56aae6cc2f17242b23efdd379e6a73e1", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt4d5nd32c", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 7, "fields": {"title": "California Missions", "slug": "california-missions", "short_title": "California Missions", "blockquote": "Establishing religious authority to convert Native Californians to Catholicism was central to Spanish colonization.

Spain\u2019s 21 California missions stretched along the El Camino Real route linking San Diego to Sonoma. This mission system was established in the late 18th century, largely under the guidance of Father Junipero Serra. Serra, a politically powerful Franciscan priest, personally founded ine missions, expanding the system into Alta California.</p><p>Father Serra performed thousands of Native American baptisms. His burial site at Mission Carmel continued to be a veneration site long after his death in 1784, as we see in the photographs of soldiers and people surrounding his grave in 1882.</p><p>Early sketches of mission life, such as the image of dancing Native Americans at Mission San Francisco de Assisi (later Mission Dolores) and the scene of the same mission\u2019s outbuildings, show the missions as a living place where different groups interacted to create the mission community.</p><p>Coerced <a href=\"/exhibitions/2/native-americans-19th-century/\">Native American labor</a> was crucial to the construction and survival of each mission. With Mexico\u2019s independence and decision to secularize the missions, Native Americans were released from previous arrangements made with the Spanish religious authority. Without this captive labor, many missions did not survive. Several images show mission buildings crumbling or overgrown with vegetation by the late 19th century. Although several missions decayed beyond repair, many continue to be restored by the communities that have evolved alongside them. For instance, the 1930 photograph of the heavily scaffolded facade of Mission San Diego demonstrates the community restoration efforts to save the main entrance. Community members of all ages joined in the rededication ceremony that followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photographs show that the missions have become a crucial link to California\u2019s past, and continued to serve changing communities. In the early 20th century, a Native American band and <a href=\"/exhibitions/19/native-americans-and-contact/\">assimilated</a> Native American children were photographed alongside Mission San Diego; a mother and daughter enjoyed the courtyard fountain of Mission Santa Barbara later in the century; and Mission Dolores Park provided housing for refugees after the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, mission architectural styles influence modern structures throughout California. Spanish tile roofs, arched walkways, and interior courtyards are the foundation of all mission-style architecture. These materials and techniques were refashioned for the Southern California housing boom in the 1970s, as seen in the Mission Viejo model home photograph \u2014 and, as the final photograph shows, on a much smaller scale in elementary school classrooms each year, as California students research and recreate the missions.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic0b.html", "hero": "9fbcec2c7a574cbb166a680e42b2c99d", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/tf2x0nb4q3", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 8, "fields": {"title": "Early California Exploration and Settlement", "slug": "early-california-exploration-and-settlement", "short_title": "Early California Exploration and Settlement", "blockquote": "California has always been a place of cultural interaction.

Early California evolved and changed with each new group of settlers. These images depict the developing interconnectedness of California's early cultures. They also underscore the importance of movement and later settlement of peoples in California. Some of the modern images underscore the contested and often romanticized nature of California\u2019s Spanish and Mexican heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 18th century, the Spanish in California were joined by other European groups. Russian settlements in northern California (shown in the two images of Fort Ross) connected Russia to its other sea otter trade routes, were places to grow food for their Alaskan settlements, and served as bases for trade with Californians. Before the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the French controlled much of what would border both Spanish territory on the West Coast and the newly formed United States to the east. The ink drawing shows a French diplomat being received at Mission Carmel in 1786.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early European images of California show these settlers' interest in Native Americans already inhabiting the area. The engraving of Captain Rogers' men being received by Native American men on the shores of California in the early 1800s depicts the two groups shaking hands and the Native Americans guiding the newcomers to shore. The engraving underscores the newness of the interaction, with the Native American men inspecting the explorers\u2019 hair and clothing. The numbers of European and Native American men appear relatively equal in this early engraving; but the ravages of disease from exposure to Europeans would <a href=\"/exhibitions/2/native-americans-19th-century/\">decimate Native American populations</a> by the mid- to late 19th century. The Russian sketch of mules and an Indian boy, and the illustration of the padrone and the Indian boy, show the cultural contact and adaptations underway by the early 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Natural harbors and waterways made San Francisco an early site for the rapid influx of people and settlements. The series of three images of San Francisco illustrates the city's expansive growth in less than 40 years. The 1815 painting shows the view toward the San Francisco Presidio with the Bay and one ship in the far distance. As late as 1837, the print of the view towards the San Francisco Presidio from the ships entering the Bay still show very few settlements in the distance. By the time of the lithograph dated 1851 (one year after California joined the United States, and two years after the <a href=\"/exhibitions/15/growth-of-cities-in-the-gold-rush-era/\">Gold Rush</a>), San Francisco is teeming with buildings, tents, people, and livestock, and the Bay is clogged with arriving ships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Military presence was central to the success of each new settlement. It is depicted in both Spanish presidio images and in American fortifications like Sutter's Fort, shown here in a book illustration. Each shows the walls and soldiers meant to provide shelter and protection to the surrounding farms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The images in this topic tend to show California\u2019s rapid transition from exploration to settlement from a European viewpoint. The sketches and paintings by early 19th-century Russian artist Ludwig Choris show his interest in Native American arms and utensils, dance performances, and portrait heads. But as the Spanish mission system expands, and immigrants from the Gold Rush crowd California, artists begin to reflect the power of Manifest Destiny. Their emphasis shifts to documenting \"modern\" progress in the construction of buildings, forts, and migration routes like the Overland Route. By 1866 (nearly fifteen years after California's statehood and heavily influenced by the ideas of Manifest Destiny), a certificate from the Society of California Pioneers uses a series of images to mark major historical transitions within California's history leading up to and glorifying United States control.</p><p>Into the 20th century and today, the legacy of California\u2019s early exploration and settlement is apparent in daily life. By exploring the many place markers of Spanish exploration (shown in the 1960s AAA map of California's Spanish heritage), modern Californians may continue to engage with the region\u2019s unique past. The 1979 <a href=\"/exhibitions/61/hispanic-americans-politics-and-community-1970s-present/\">Chicano mural</a> depicting a fight between a Spanish conquistador and an Aztec eagle knight underscores the central role European conquest played in shaping California.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic0c.html", "hero": "f50dd5b94a4f1bd9b05027080740ddc6", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/tf067nb1kc", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 9, "fields": {"title": "Rich Resources in California, 1780-1880", "slug": "rich-resources-in-california-1780-1880", "short_title": "Rich Resources", "blockquote": "Natural resources like water, lumber, and oil\u2014along with human-driven resources like transportation, agriculture, and technology\u2014have all contributed to California's growth.", "byline": "\"Rich Resources in California, 1780-1880\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2009.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2009, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>These images show the importance of both California's natural and human resource potential to the state\u2019s development and subsequent wealth.

As successive groups of settlers and citizens tried to control and harness the state\u2019s water (both for survival and to capitalize on California's agricultural and mineral potential), the landscape was transformed. Irrigation was crucial to <a href=\"/exhibitions/6/californio-society/\">Californio</a> ranchos and to the <a href=\"/exhibitions/14/environmental-impact-in-the-gold-rush-era/\">hydraulic mining</a> of another lucrative resource \u2014 <a href=\"/exhibitions/t3/gold-rush-era-1848-1865/\">gold</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting water to people and fields was a problem. One photograph shows an early irrigation system for citrus orchards; another shows water being packed in on mules.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, flooding (as shown by the photograph of men boating down a flooded San Jose street in 1911) was a problem. Levees were built to hold back waters from flooding cities, as pictured in Sacramento in 1913.</p><p>Large-scale irrigation projects helped the state evolve into the nation's leading agricultural producer, especially in formerly arid regions. The humorous photograph of a burro in Death Valley is a truer picture of much of the Southern California landscape before water management\u2019s dramatic changes.</p><p>California's population exploded in the 20th century, and more water began to be diverted to serve people and agriculture. A photograph shows the opening of the head gates for the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which fueled the city\u2019s rapid growth.</p><p>In the 1920s, the Hetch Hetchy Valley, near Yosemite, was converted into a reservoir to serve San Francisco\u2019s growing water supply needs. Compare the early 1900s photograph of the Hetch Hetchy Valley before flooding, and the 1948 photograph of the reservoir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beginning in the 19th century, <a href=\"/exhibitions/18/the-transcontinental-railroad/\">railroads</a> transported people, agriculture, lumber, and gold in and out of California. Back-breaking railroad construction (pictured in the 1970 Henry Sugimoto painting) encouraged immigration and migration of different ethnic laborers, including Chinese, African Americans, and Europeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil, the 20th century\u2019s \u201cblack gold,\u201d helped to fuel industrial development, especially in Southern California. The prosperous family photographed at the Lucille Oil Company in 1907 shows the early stages of the oil industry. By 1930, the photograph of the family visiting the Coalinga oil fields displays the multitude of oil derricks dotting the landscape.</p><p>The people needed to design and construct large-scale water projects, harvest crops, build railroads, and create new industries are all crucial components of California's wealth. Men, women, and children of various ethnic and racial backgrounds all contributed to the growth and development of California\u2019s industries. The images here show women working in the fields and supervising the Hetch Hetchy project. The photograph of campesinos, and the Victor Ochoa mural entitled \"Labor in San Diego,\" reminds us that farm work often involves families and migrant communities. </p><p>Although California was no stranger to new <a href=\"/exhibitions/23/the-rise-of-technology-early-20th-century-california/\">technological achievements</a>, the rapid development of the computer industry in and around the Silicon Valley area bolstered the state\u2019s prominence within the global economy.

A few years later, in 1878, a group of men commemorates the completion of part of the Cajon Canal, bringing water to Southern California. </p><p>The new cities began to thrive as new residents moved in. The Broadway lumber yard is a bustling place, as people shop for lumber to build the new city of Oakland. In the photo of San Francisco\u2019s Kearny Street in the 1860s, pedestrians and trolleys shared the cobblestone street. </p><p>Native Americans at this time were in transition between cultures. In Yosemite, a Native American gathering was captured by photographer Eadweard Muybridge. In the 1860s, another photograph shows a family of Washoe Indians near a river.</p><p>Among the images from this time are those picturing people enjoying relaxing activities of many sorts. In the 1880s, swimmers posed in the water near Anaheim Landing, near what is now Seal Beach. In Mammoth Grove, people enjoying the outdoors pose with a giant redwood. In Anaheim, 12 men and boys show off game from a rabbit hunting party. In Laguna Beach in the 1880s, some women pose for a picture </p><p>The images in this topic portray the new state of California as it was taking shape and its citizens were taking root: At the Slough School in Sutter County, and in Visalia, teachers stand with their students. In 1875, a wedding party poses for a photograph to celebrate a marriage. Cities, too, were laying down social foundations: Anaheim took a photograph of its first city band, and The Deluge Hose Company #2 was San Bernardino's first fire company, equipped with axes, ladders, hooks, buckets, fire bell, and a speaking trumpet.

These photographs show some of the everyday people of the time, as well as the shops, saloons, and other establishments that served them.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Many people who came to California to strike it rich eventually abandoned their dreams of gold. They stayed in California and worked as farmers or merchants, relaxing in saloons or coffee houses and marrying and raising families.  This group contains several portraits captured in Daguerreotypes and cased photographs that depict a variety of everyday people: a young Gold Rush widow in black mourning attire; a gold seeker with a pick axe, a pan, and a gun; and a farmer and wagon maker (who founded the town of Dixon in 1852), alongside images of his two children.</p><p>The daily needs of people during the Gold Rush were much like ours today. Photographs of buildings shown here include a furniture store, a mortuary, a general merchandise store, and a grocery.</p><p>The mining industry and the growing population triggered a need for timber. As one lithograph illustrates, abandoned wooden ships that would otherwise be left in the bay were pulled ashore and turned into stores and buildings in San Francisco. In rural areas and mining towns, buildings were often constructed of unfinished logs, like the Coyote and Deer Creek Water Co. office near Nevada City.</p><p>In their leisure time some people frequented coffee houses or saloons. There was even a barroom in at least one gold mine, as one lithograph shows. The photograph of Abe Warner\u2019s Cobweb Palace in San Francisco \u2014 a saloon that was formerly a butcher shop \u2014 shows monkeys and parrots roaming freely.

Many of these problems were directly related to gold-mining technology. The process of hydraulic mining, which became popular in the 1850s, caused irreparable environmental destruction. Two images show California's largest hydraulic mine \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=494\">Malakoff Diggings,</a> in Nevada County \u2014 in action. (Malakoff Diggings is now a state park and open to visitors.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dams (such as the English Dam in Nevada County, shown in one photograph), which were constructed to help supply water to the mines during the dry summer months, changed the course of rivers. The sediment washed away by hydraulic mining clogged riverbeds and lakes, threatening agriculture throughout the Central Valley. Conflicts over water arose between mining and farming interests. Hydraulic mining essentially came to an end in 1884 with the Sawyer Decision, legislation passed to resolve this conflict.</p><p>The mining industry also needed a great deal of wood, both to fuel the boilers at the mines and to build extensive canal systems. This demand for lumber helped create the logging industry. California's forests had plenty of trees to log, many quite large. The lithograph \"The Stump and Trunk of the Mammoth Tree of Calaveras\" depicts a society ball at which 32 people danced on the stump of a giant sequoia tree.</p><p>Photographer Carleton E. Watkins was well known for his images of the grand views of the West. He was the first to capture Yosemite on film, and helped shape how people throughout the country and the world viewed California. He took many of the broad landscape photos in this group. Watkins also made use of the new technology of the day to create stereoscopic views, including the image of the Malakoff Diggings.</p><p>There are also several Daguerreotypes in this topic.

Some of these cities were veritable boomtowns: San Francisco, a small village in 1847, was a bustling city by 1849, just two years later. San Francisco's population boom even had an impact on its geography. One image from 1847 shows Montgomery Street on the waterfront; but a photograph taken in 1862 shows that the waterfront had been filled to increase the city's real estate, pushing Montgomery Street inland.</p><p>Southern California also had its share of rapidly growing cities. Between 1850 and 1870, a span of just 20 years, the population of Los Angeles County grew from 3,530 and 15,309. Lithographs  show a bird's eye view of the city and outlying farmland, a vastly different city than the Los Angeles of today. Two photographs of substantial buildings taken in Anaheim in the 1880s \u2014 one of a hotel \u2014 show clear evidence of growth.</p><p>The cities continued to grow because more and more people migrated to California, despite the long and difficult journey. Many transportation businesses encouraged travel to California, and posters advertising travel fares reflected the different ways that people could travel to and within the Golden State: by ship, by train, or in a horse-drawn stagecoach.

Some also express the anti-Chinese feeling that resulted in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Starting with the Gold Rush, Chinese migrated to California and other regions of the United States in search of work. As several photographs show, many Chinese found work in the gold mines and on the railroads. They accepted $32.50 a month to work on the Union Pacific in Wyoming in 1870 for the same job that paid white workers $52 a month. This led to deep resentment by the whites, who felt the Chinese were competing unfairly for jobs.</p><p>White labor unions blamed the Chinese for lower wages and lack of jobs, and anti-Chinese feelings grew. The cartoon \"You Know How It Is Yourself\" expresses this sentiment. Several political cartoons in this topic are graphic representations of racism and conflicts between whites and Chinese. \"Won't They Remain Here in Spite of the New Constitution?\" shows a demonized figure of political corruption protecting Chinese cheap labor, dirty politicians, capital, and financiers. \"The Tables Turned\" shows Denis Kearney (head of the Workingman's Party of California, a union that had criticized Chinese laborers) in jail, being taunted by Chinese men.</p><p>In 1880, President Rutherford B. Hayes signed the Chinese Exclusion Treaty, which placed strict limitations on the number of Chinese allowed to enter the United States and the number allowed to become naturalized citizens. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which prohibited immigration from China (The Act was not repealed until 1943). The two-part cartoon from the July-December 1882 issue of <i>The Wasp</i> reflects how some citizens saw the situation. After the Act was passed, anti-Chinese violence increased. One illustration depicts the Rock Springs Massacre of 1885, a Wyoming race riot in which 28 Chinese were killed by British and Swedish miners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The \"Certificate of Residence\" document illustrates that Chinese individuals were required to prove their residence in the United States prior to the passage of the Exclusion Act. The poster offering a reward for Wong Yuk, a Chinese man, makes it clear that the United States was actively deporting Chinese.</p><p>Despite discrimination and prejudice, this first wave of immigrants established thriving communities. Photographs taken in San Francisco's Chinatown show prosperous businesses, such as the \"Chinese Butcher and Grocery Shop.\" Wealthy merchants formed active business associations, represented by the image \"Officers of the Chinese Six Companies.\" The Chinese celebrated their heritage by holding cultural festivals, as shown in the photograph from 1896. The photographs \"Children of High Class,\" \"Golden Gate Park,\" and \"Chinese Passengers on Ferry\" are evidence that some Chinese adopted Western-style clothing while others wore more traditional attire.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic2a.html", "hero": "a0dc8bb07186142a9238208a3eaba1d9", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/tf329006p9", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 18, "fields": {"title": "The Transcontinental Railroad", "slug": "the-transcontinental-railroad", "short_title": "The Transcontinental Railroad", "blockquote": "The transcontinental railroad connected the east and west coasts of the United States with a single rail line.

This had a profound impact on the nation as a whole, and on California \u2014 the end of the line \u2014 in particular. The images in this group show different aspects of the railroad, including workers, travelers, tracks, railroad bridges, and trains.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>In 1862, Congress passed and President Lincoln signed the Pacific Railroad Bill, which granted public land and funds to build a transcontinental railroad. The Central Pacific Railroad would lay tracks from California heading east, and the Union Pacific Railroad would lay tracks from the Missouri River west. The photograph taken in Placer County, \"Grading the Central Pacific Railroad,\" shows some of the construction.</p><p>Work on the railroad was physically difficult and at times dangerous, and attracting workers was a challenge. The majority of the Central Pacific's laborers were Chinese. A Chinese worker is shown in the image \"Heading (top cut) of East Portal, Tunnel No. 8.\" Both railroad companies actively recruited Chinese laborers because they were regarded as hard workers and were willing to accept a lower wage than white workers, mostly Irish immigrants.</p><p>As construction progressed, the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific competed to see which could lay the most track each day. The meeting of the two sets of tracks \u2014 the \"gold spike\" ceremony \u2014 took place on May 10, 1869. Several photographs and drawings depict this historic moment.</p><p>Now the country was connected as never before: a journey between San Francisco and New York that previously took up to six months now took only days.  The photograph \"High Bridge in Loop,\" from Views from a Trip to California, shows a train passing quickly through a mountain pass. The transcontinental railroad allowed people to travel more, farther, and in pleasant conditions, as reflected in the photograph \"Commissary Car, 'Elkhorn Club.'\" The photograph \"Knights of Pythias at the Santa Fe Railway Station, Anaheim\" shows an example of the popularity of trains.</p><p>Even as the transcontinental railroad brought the new country together, it brought change to the world of Native Americans. The tracks ran through a number of tribal territories, bringing into conflict cultures that held very different views of the land and how it might be used and lived on. The painting <i>The First Train,</i> by Herbert Schuyler, depicts three Indians pointing past their encampment at a train in the far distance. The railroad also brought an increasing number of European Americans west. One consequence of this influx was the depletion of the buffalo herds, a major food source for Plains Indians. European Americans would often shoot buffalo for sport from the train; by 1880, the buffalo were mostly gone and Plains Indians had been gathered onto reservations. Millions of acres of open grassland were being settled by the people moving west. Eventually, much of this land became the farmland that fed a growing nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The transcontinental railroad opened up the West to the rest of the country, even if they never made the trip themselves. A Currier &amp; Ives hand-colored lithograph depicts a train running along the Truckee River in Northern California. The San Francisco publishing firm of Lawrence &amp; Houseworth hired photographers and published photographic tourist catalogs containing views of the West, which they sold commercially. The railroad took hold in popular culture, as shown by sheet music for the song \"New Express Galop [sic].\" There was even a railroad board game illustrating \"Railroads Between New York and San Francisco, California, with Scenes on the Way.\"</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic2b.html", "hero": "63585735f4c30a38827ad9065bb710eb", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/tf8199p4zc", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 19, "fields": {"title": "Native Americans and Contact", "slug": "native-americans-and-contact", "short_title": "Native Americans and Contact", "blockquote": "As tribal lands and structures disappeared or were taken away, many aspects of Native Americans' lives changed.", "byline": "\"Native Americans and Contact\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>The images in this topic reflect the dissolution of tribal structure that occurred over the course of the 19th century. As traditional Native American lands disappeared or were taken away, many aspects of their daily lives changed, including housing, clothing, food sources, livelihood, and religion.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Beginning in the 1700s, the Spaniards built the California Missions to make contact with Native Americans in the hope of converting them to Christianity. One painting by a Russian artist depicts a group of Native Americans dancing in front of Mission Dolores in San Francisco; a later photograph shows a group of nuns with westernized native children in front of the Pala Mission in Southern California.</p><p>As European Americans continued to migrate West throughout the 1800s, they came into conflict with the native peoples who lived there. Native Americans were increasingly pushed off their lands and forced onto reservations. At the same time, whites pressured Native Americans to assimilate. Native American children were sent away to boarding schools with the goal of socializing them and teaching them \u201cwhite ways.\u201d Several photographs depict young Native American children wearing western dress in boarding school settings. Some of the photographs taken in the mid-1800s show Native Americans wearing traditional clothing (including \"Jicarilla Apache Brave and Squaw, lately wedded,\" \"Coyotero Apache Scouts,\" and \"Group of Apaches, in front of the Wick-8-ups [sic]\"). Photographs taken at the turn of the 20th century, such as \"Pummuke\" and \"Chief Chepah, his wife, son, and daughter-in-law,\" indicate that by then even older Native Americans were adopting Western dress.</p><p>Several photographs in this topic are from government-sponsored survey expeditions launched in the early 1870s to chart western lands and native peoples. These expeditions coincided with the beginning of anthropology as a science. In 1879, Congress created the Bureau of Ethnology to study and document the native people and their cultures. Included here are three portraits taken for these ethnographic field studies, and a painting of Sitting Bull, the famous Sioux medicine chief.</p><p>Native Americans clashed violently and repeatedly with the white European Americans moving into their territory. The whites wanted to push the Indians off their land and onto reservations, but the Indians often refused to go. The Lakota branch of the Sioux tribe was one such group, and in 1875 their refusal resulted in the Lakota War. A famous battle in the Lakota War took place at the Little Bighorn River in Montana in 1876; there, US forces under General George Armstrong Custer attacked Crazy Horse and hundreds of Lakota and Northern Cheyenne warriors. In the battle, which came to be known as Custer's Last Stand, Custer's men were outnumbered four to one and every white man was killed. A drawing and a color lithograph show versions of this battle. Some Crow served as scouts for General Custer in the 7th Cavalry. One stereoscopic view shows \"Curley\" \u2014 the only Indian survivor fighting on Custer's side \u2014 wearing a buffalo coat and sitting astride a horse.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic2c.html", "hero": "06142914d7c5e55ba0a9a5b4a369cb2c", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/tf0b69n9s7", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 20, "fields": {"title": "Preservation of the American West", "slug": "preservation-of-the-american-west", "short_title": "Preservation of the West", "blockquote": "Photographs taken on government-sponsored expeditions promoted the scenic beauty of the West and helped make the case for its protection.", "byline": "\"Preservation of the American West\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>Most of these images are the result of government-sponsored expeditions to record the mineral wealth and landscape of the western United States. They show the land in transition, and some of the people and politicians responsible for trying to preserve it.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>During the late 1800s, American industry's demand for more and more natural resources pushed Congress to recognize the need to explore and chart the geological characteristics and mineral wealth of the country. In 1864, William Brewer (seen third from the left in \"Field Party of 1864\"), chief botanist of the California Geological Survey, led the first state-sponsored expedition to survey, map, chart, document, and photograph vast, previously unexplored areas of California. </p><p>The government sponsored several such expeditions to survey and map the territories of the United States. The many photographs taken on these expeditions were used to promote the geographic wonders and scenic beauty of the West to the rest of the country and led to a move to preserve areas of natural beauty and protect them against development.</p><p>In 1871, photographer William H. Jackson traveled to <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yell/\">Yellowstone</a> with an expedition led by Ferdinand V. Hayden, a Civil War veteran and later head of the US Geological Survey (the USGS was officially established in 1879). Jackson took the stereoscopic views of the park included here. The following year, as a result of this expedition, Congress passed the Yellowstone Act of 1872 to protect over 2 million acres in northwest Wyoming, designating the Yellowstone area as the world\u2019s first National Park. \r\nIn California, naturalist and conservationist John Muir (shown seated on a boulder in one photograph) educated and informed the public about the beauty of the state and its need to be preserved. He was instrumental in the move to set aside <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/yose/\">Yosemite</a> as a National Park. Muir was influential in convincing President Teddy Roosevelt of the need to conserve these lands. One photograph of the president's visit to Yosemite shows Muir and Roosevelt standing on a rock at Yosemite's Glacier Point. Another shows Roosevelt with a party of Secret Service men and government officials at Mariposa Grove. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carlton Watkins was among the first to photograph Yosemite. He became well known for his magnificent, large plate images of the park, including the images of Bridal Veil, El Capitan, and Nevada Fall, shown here. His images played a significant role in promoting the West to the rest of the country. An image of sheet music from 1873 called \"Yosemite Waltzes\" reflects how the park was quickly incorporated into popular culture.</p><p>The logging industry, which began during the Gold Rush years, had gained a foothold in California and the Pacific Northwest. One 1872 photograph depicts loggers in Mammoth Forest about to cut down a massive tree (said to be 5,000 years old) that would later be reassembled for the World's Fair in order to show the rest of the world just how big things were in the West. But as logging and other industries grew, and it became clear that the West had a finite amount of natural wealth, the conservation movement gained momentum. In 1892, the Sierra Club began at the University of California, Berkeley, to promote conservation and involve people in the great outdoors by organizing hikes and outings. One photograph shows club members on an outing in Sequoia Forest in 1902. Other photographs picture two women hiking to Glacier Point, and a family camping in Yosemite in 1906.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic2d.html", "hero": "c5c8795eeb0c0977493a21f84ed6868b", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/tf5p3008f6", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 21, "fields": {"title": "Everyday Life and People in Late-19th Century California", "slug": "everyday-life-and-people-in-late-19th-century-california", "short_title": "Everyday Life and People", "blockquote": "Just as they do today, people in the late 19th century worked to earn a living, and enjoyed having fun in their free time.", "byline": "\"Everyday Life and People in Late-19th Century California\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2009.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2009, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>The images in this topic show how Californians in the late 19th century worked and played.

The \"wild \r\nWest\" disappeared; people of European descent \r\nincreasingly \r\ncame into contact with Native Americans and forced them off their lands,killed them, or pressured them to <a href=\"/exhibitions/19/native-americans-and-contact/\">assimilate</a>; and cities and towns grew quickly. Loggers, like these near Fresno, cut down trees to provide lumber for houses, buildings, and ships. The <a href=\"/exhibitions/t3/gold-rush-era-1848-1865/\">Gold Rush</a> was over by the late 1860s, but there was still work to be found in mining, as these images of placer miners in Tuolumne County illustrate. Mercury miners at the New Almaden Quicksilver Mine in Santa Clara (the largest in the United States) are seen riding a crude elevator up from the underground mines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many others found work, as they do today, in serving people's daily needs. In a photo from 1885, two young barbers offer shaves for a dime in Anaheim. The opening of the People's Meat Market in Yuba City, in 1875, occasioned the image shown here. In a photograph taken around the same time, dressed carcasses hanging in front of T. F. Allen's butcher shop in San Bernardino leave no doubt about what's for sale inside. A blacksmith in Covina is shown forging iron shoes for the horses that were still the primary mode of transportation for most people.</p><p>Small and large farms, like those depicted here, were also a source of income for many people. The introduction of mechanized machinery, like that shown in Pleasant Grove in 1890, made the work go faster. In the background, you can see the workhorse in use at the same time.</p><p>Some farms, like the Bullard Winery in Anaheim, were more specialized. This photograph shows three people bottling wine. Produce from the farms went to markets in towns and cities, but it was also sold by independent sellers. In one image a Chinese immigrant around 1885-90, deprived of the right to earn a living by the <a href=\"/exhibitions/17/chinese-exclusion-act/\">Chinese Exclusion Act</a>, is peddling produce from large baskets he carries on his shoulders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entertainments ranged from novel spectator sports \u2013 like the San Diegans watching a hot air balloon in 1888 \u2013 to the athletic. A new national craze swept America: riding bicycles. The two young racers pictured here eventually became Pacific Coast riding champions. Some, like the Schmidt family shown having a painting lesson in their parlor, engaged in quieter activities. School children participated in organized fun, such as this Maypole dance in San Mateo, and the hoop drill at a school in Pasadena.</p><p>With the closing of the frontier apparent, the <a href=\"/exhibitions/20/preservation-of-the-american-west/\">preservation of the West</a> became an issue. People began to spend their leisure time not in town, but in the wilderness\u2013now beginning to be organized into parklands\u2013as campers. As campers do today, they fished and hiked and climbed mountains \u2013 although, as is evident in some of these images, they wore somewhat more formal attire. As forests continued to be cleared for other purposes, the remaining big trees, and the stumps that were left, became tourist attractions in their own right.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic2e.html", "hero": "e0392bca6f9aea4265337faa48292f0d", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt2x0nc2rf", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 22, "fields": {"title": "The Changing Workplace", "slug": "the-changing-workplace-early-20th-century-california", "short_title": "The Changing Workplace", "blockquote": "The 20th century ushered in a change from handcrafting to machine tooling and mass production.

These images show the importance of machinery in the workplace, and how people worked in assembly lines.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>The 20th century ushered in a change from handcrafting to machine tooling. Henry Ford introduced one of the first moving assembly lines as a way to turn out more cars more quickly, and the emerging auto industry popularized this mode. A photo of the Doble Steam Motors Corporation factory shows a line of workers and car chassis in production. This new technology, and the spread of industrialization, changed forever the way that work was completed.</p><p>A wide variety of industries all across the country converted to mechanization, and California was no exception. One 1929 image shows young women working in a towel factory in Orange. Photographs taken in San Francisco illustrate that workers used machines to make products as different as Ghirardelli Chocolate and music rolls for automated player pianos. Images also show  women working on an assembly line in a soap factory, and men sewing clothes in a shop (at a time when a good suit, cut on machines instead of by hand, retailed for $40 to $50).</p><p>Automation and mechanization also changed agricultural practices. The combined traction steam harvester built by Stockton J. Barry on his California ranch was one of the machines that changed the way produce was harvested. Mechanized canning changed the way fruit and vegetables were processed and preserved, and made out-of-season produce available year round. Photographs in this group show cannery workers at tables, and cans going through a labeling machine. The introduction of mechanized food processing eventually brought a new awareness of the importance of standards for foods production. The Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act were both passed in 1906</p><p>As workers nationwide adjusted to an increasingly mechanized workplace, good working conditions took on new importance. Workers in several industries formed unions (such as the Berryessa Fruit Growers formed in 1920, shown here) to promote safer working conditions and limit maximum working hours.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic3a.html", "hero": "d93735f829763b3decc074ab2edf1380", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt1g5018kh", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 23, "fields": {"title": "The Rise of Technology", "slug": "the-rise-of-technology-early-20th-century-california", "short_title": "The Rise of Technology", "blockquote": "At the turn of the 20th century, new technological advances such as electricity, flight, and the gasoline engine found expression in new modes of transportation and communication.", "byline": "\"The Rise of Technology in Early 20th Century California\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At the turn of the 20th century, new technological advances such as electricity, flight, and the gasoline engine found expression in new modes of transportation and communication. The images in this topic reflect how these inventions changed daily life in small and large ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Airplanes, electric railways, and automobiles joined railways to fuel Americans' growing sense of mobility. They came to characterize the progressive spirit of the new century. As a result of these new modes of public transportation, people were able to travel faster and more easily within and between cities, changing settlement patterns. One image in this group depicts John J. Montgomery, the first American to fly a heavier-than-air machine, and his glider \u201cSanta Clara\u201d in 1905. An invitation to an air show in San Jose in 1910 suggests the popularity of this potential new mode of transportation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several cities had electric streetcars that ran on tracks, and images in this group include streetcars in San Diego, San Jose, and Los Angeles. The hand-tinted image of the Interurban Electric Rail Road running between Saratoga and Los Gatos suggests that in 1908, this was enough of a novelty to rate a postcard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The automobile industry was also growing rapidly. Before the internal combustion engine took the lead in the 1910s, cars ran on a variety of fuels; steam, electricity, and gasoline competed for a number of years. This is clearly evident from the two ads that appeared in the <span class=\"cite\">Saturday Evening Post</span> for the steam car, and several images of people enjoying both electric- and gas-powered cars.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Some inventions aimed to make life easier at home. The photograph of a storefront in 1925 shows the existence of appliances such as washing machines, ironing machines, and vacuum cleaners. In their new-found leisure time, people listened to the radio, an invention that was fairly new at this time. Two photographs taken in the mid-1920s show Charles Herrold, the \u201cFather of Radio,\u201d operating radio equipment. The combination of new technologies, more free time, and the ability to get from one place to another relatively easily and quickly allowed people to enjoy new forms of entertainment, as indicated by the photograph of a car in front of a movie theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expositions were a popular venue to showcase the latest in technology, and several images here represent expositions that took place in San Francisco and San Diego in 1915 and 1916.

They also illustrate some of the challenges they faced in assimilating into California society.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>People from around the world continued to come to California in the early 1900s, many in search of work and a better life. Two photographs depict men in turbans in San Francisco in 1910. Southern California attracted numerous Japanese immigrants. Photographs in this group show Japanese workers standing in front of delivery trucks at the Nakamura Company and inside Japanese owned businesses such as the Kusumoto Barbershop in Anaheim.</p><p>Mexicans and Filipinos also came to California during this period. As new farming technologies enabled the consolidation of smaller parcels of land into large farms up and down the state, the need for workers increased. In response, many Filipinos came to work in the fields and in related agricultural jobs. \"Snapshot of Workers' Camp\" shows some of these men.</p><p>Mexican and Japanese immigrants also found agricultural work in California. Photographs in this group show Japanese workers in a field; and another image shows a young Mexican agricultural worker. The photograph of workers in the Tokay grape packing shed in Florin shows a diversity of workers, including an African American woman and Japanese and Filipino men.</p><p>This mix of very different cultures gave rise to tensions and conflicts. Migrant workers were threatened and warned not to take jobs away from other groups. Images include two letters  threatening a farmer with reprisals if he hires Filipinos; and a US Immigration sign in Spanish threatening non-citizens with deportation if they go on strike.</p><p>Although the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 prevented new immigrants from coming to the United States, the Chinese who were already here continued to assimilate into Western culture. A photograph taken in 1910 shows an unidentified San Diego Chinese American family. Anti-Chinese discrimination continued, as evidenced by a letter from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce pointing out the unfair conditions inflicted by the Immigration Law of 1924. Nonetheless, many of these images show that Chinese people persevered, engaging in daily activities \u2014 going to school, working, walking in a funeral procession.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic3c.html", "hero": "4b64c1bf2c88a2376aee5e3d8838d87e", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt267nc3qt", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 25, "fields": {"title": "Early Advertising in California", "slug": "early-advertising-in-california", "short_title": "Early Advertising", "blockquote": "The modern advertising industry really began in the early 1900s.

These early advertising images show how companies approached the business of selling products, places, and ideas in the early 20th century.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>The promotion of products, particularly national brands, began to become more prevalent in the early 1900s. Some categories of advertising shown in this group of images are still with us today: cars, cigarettes, and products aimed at homemakers. In California, car dealers and garages used advertising to promote products and services early on. One photograph shows the Lush Garage in Orange promoting Goodrich Tires as the \"Best in the Long Run.\" In 1936, a photographic postcard for the Chevrolet Garage in Pomona offered 12 lube jobs for $6 in time payments. And as another image illustrates, one still-recognizable brand, Schlitz Beer, got on the advertising bandwagon early at an automobile race in 1908.</p><p>Photographs of displays from the Westwood Hardware and Furniture Store in 1936 advertise kitchen stoves and camps stoves from Coleman; and Dr. West's toothbrushes, with bristles that \"will not get soggy.\" A 1929 photo shows a baker and two women in costume advertising Piping Pan Cakery Compound in San Diego.</p><p>California was linked with oranges for decades, thanks to early promotion by fruit producers. A hand-tinted postcard from 1908 shows two men in an orange orchard. Colorful ads on fruit crates were a popular form of promotion, and California-grown oranges and lemons presented idealistic images of California in their ads. Some examples shown here include the Sonny brand, with an image of a mother reading to her son; Hewes' Transcontinental Brand, with a train roaring across the country; and the Comet Brand, with a shooting star flying over citrus groves and mountains. \r\nCities got into the act as well, and the tourism industry began to employ advertising. The Southern California city of Orange described itself in its 12-page, orange leaf-illustrated brochure as \"a charming little city of 9,000 souls\" and even had a tag line: \"Orange. You\u2019ll like it.\" In 1936, Gallup, New Mexico, used a postcard to promote its Inter-Tribal Indian Ceremonial events.</p><p>As the United States entered World War II, it sponsored advertising promoting behavior, ideas, and nationalistic sentiments. The billboard \"Buy Stamps \u2014 Buy Bonds \u2014 Bye Bye Japs!\" which seems shocking today, encouraged people to buy US savings bonds and help fund US war efforts. In fact, according to a caption by photographer Dorothea Lange, she shot this image on April 29, 1942, the day that 600 Japanese Americans were evacuated to internment camps. Another Lange photograph captured an ad for swimming at the Sutro Baths that also tapped into anti-Japanese sentiment with a derogatory stereotypical image and the tagline \"Get in Trim for Fighting Him!\"</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic3d.html", "hero": "59e5c6aa89ded941ee6028943ca21922", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt6q2nc0rd", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 26, "fields": {"title": "Popular Culture in Early-20th Century California", "slug": "popular-culture-early-20th-century-california", "short_title": "Popular Culture", "blockquote": "New technologies, shorter workdays, and the growth of a consumer society influenced the way people spent their free time in the early 20th century.", "byline": "\"Popular Culture in Early 20th Century California\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>These images show some of the ways that people spent their free time during the early part of the 20th century.

At the turn of the century people found entertainment at carnivals and festivals and exhibitions. Photographs here include the California Midwinter International Exposition in San Francisco in 1894, and the Anaheim Carnival of 1911.</p><p>Sports were also a popular pastime. Photographs show people participating in tennis and golf, but spectator sports were also popular. In 1929, Miss Jessie Darnley apparently swam her way to the title of Miss Anaheim in a pool filled with three tons of oranges. A number of players became celebrities, as witnessed by publicity stills of baseball greats Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Carl Klindt.</p><p>Electricity and improved communications meant that entertainment was no longer confined to live theater. People turned to the radio for both information and entertainment. One photograph shows the family of a Democratic nominee for US Senator, Sheridan Downey, gathered around the radio listening to election results. Another depicts a live radio broadcast.</p><p>During this era the film industry boomed in Hollywood, generating popular images and mythologies surrounding the movies and movie stars. Photographs in this group include some on-set shots of actors, directors, and movie-making equipment. The owner of the famous Chinese Theater in Hollywood, Sid Grauman, is pictured with film star Mary Pickford. Other images include silent film stars, the original \"Our Gang\" cast at the opening of the Broadway Theater, and a shot of the Spreckels Theater on the night of a Three Stooges film premiere in 1934.</p><p>As had been true for centuries, people enjoyed music, literature, and the arts. Images here include jazz musicians performing and a studio portrait of Roland Hayes, considered one of the greatest tenors in the 1920s. Popular literary figures pictured include author Upton Sinclair, whose 1906 book <i>The Jungle</i> helped raise popular awareness about food processing and contributed in large part to the passage of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. Photographs of poets and writers who wrote about or resided in California include Joaquin Miller, George Sterling, Charles Warren Stoddard, Robinson Jeffers, Edwin Markham, and Mary Austin (standing in front of a mural with Mexican artist Diego Rivera).</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic3e.html", "hero": "014019db0801fd51bfe63aaa73cd6a35", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt1m3nc34b", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 27, "fields": {"title": "Everyday Life and People in the Early 20th Century", "slug": "everyday-life-and-people-in-the-early-20th-century", "short_title": "Everyday Life and People", "blockquote": "A shorter workday and eventually a national weekend meant that ordinary working Americans\u2014not just the wealthy\u2014had leisure time.", "byline": "\"Everyday Life and People in the Early 20th Century\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2009.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2009, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>The images in this topic offer a glimpse of the ways people in cities and towns across California relaxed and entertained themselves during the first half of the 20th century. As new technologies and improved communications brought changes to the work week, people had more free time and new choices about how to spend it.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>With each succeeding decade of the 20th century, new <a href=\"/exhibitions/23/the-rise-of-technology-early-20th-century-california/\">technologies</a> brought fundamental changes to the <a href=\"/exhibitions/22/the-changing-workplace-early-20th-century-california/\">workplace</a>, and the structure of people\u2019s daily lives. A shorter workday, Henry Ford\u2019s concept of Saturday as a day off, and eventually a national weekend meant that ordinary working Americans \u2014 not just the wealthy \u2014 had leisure time. And innovations like electricity and the gasoline engine gave them new ways to enjoy it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the turn of the century, remnants of 19th-century technology were still used daily. In 1910, Buffalo Bill Cody's troupe of Rough Riders paraded by the Oakland Tribune building in wagons and on foot, appealing to popular romantic images of the Wild West. One photo shows the Castro family wedding party traveling over Anaheim\u2019s unpaved roads in a horse-drawn wagon \u2014 in 1922.</p><p>Gas- and electric-powered machines sped up labor during the first half of the new century, and also powered the new forms of transportation that would soon replace horses. As the work week got shorter, \"motoring\" for the fun of it became a leisure-time activity. Here, a Dublin family poses with their car, perhaps ready for a drive in the country, hats on to protect from sun and wind. </p><p>People still flocked to fairs and circuses, like the one shown in San Diego in 1925, as well as to large commercial expositions like the California Valencia Orange Show. <a href=\"/exhibitions/25/early-advertising-in-california/\">Advertised</a> in fantastic publicity shots, the show featured elaborate displays made out of thousands of oranges (in 1927, $15,000 worth of oranges was on display), parades, and other entertainment, including the Spanish dancers shown here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even some prisoners got a break once a year. This photograph from the 17th annual \u201cLittle Olympics\u201d field meet held at San Quentin in 1930 shows a participant in a pie-eating contest. For one day, prison rules were suspended and prisoners participated in athletic events, sack races, and entertainments.</p><p>As the work week shrunk to five days, Saturday and Sunday sporting activities grew in popularity \u2014 not just for players, but for spectators. Baseball, college football, and golf were particularly popular. Both men and women played in local and organizational baseball teams, including the Japanese American \u201cCubs\u201d team and the 1931 champion Santiago Orange Growers Association women\u2019s baseball team from Orange, California. People also watched boxing matches, horse races, and rodeos. Some even flew planes for the fun of it. San Diego aviator Ruth Alexander, shown here, held several official and unofficial altitude records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a few short years after <a href=\"/exhibitions/t4/closing-american-frontier-1870-1900/\">the closing of the frontier</a>, \"getting back to nature\" became a fad. Motoring, for many, meant trips to <a href=\"/exhibitions/20/preservation-of-the-american-west/\">National Parks</a> and Lodging was hard to find in these remote areas, so camping \u2014 and using cars to haul equipment \u2014 became popular. A 1901 photograph shows a woman standing on top of Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, dressed modestly in a long skirt and big hat \u2014 the same clothes she might wear for a walk in town. In the 1923 photo of hikers on Mt. Tam shows, the men and women were wearing similar trousers and hats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to experience the great outdoors was from the relative comfort of the Mt. Tamalpais Railroad \u201cgravity car.\u201d The steam train shown here ferried passengers from the top of Mt. Tam down to the town of Mill Valley from 1896 to 1930. </p><p>Boating and swimming, days at the beach, fishing, and picnicking were also popular ways to spend the day. A 1922 photograph of a family picnic in an oil field near Coalinga shows the oil derricks as just part of the scenery on a sunny afternoon.</p><p>In the late 1930s, the two-day weekend officially began nationwide. Many city streets were now lit with electricity, and people drove or took <a href=\"/exhibitions/23/the-rise-of-technology-early-20th-century-california/\">electric trolleys</a> to enjoy late nights on the town. Southern California\u2019s movie industry brought images of glamour to movie palaces in cities and towns across the state. In the photo shown here, a crowd mills outside a showing of <i>Mutiny on the Bounty</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Average people now wanted to enjoy the glamour they saw in the movies, reflected by the \"posed\" look of several images in this topic. The formal, organized dances of the earlier century gave way to more personal expressions, like the jitterbug competition shown here. Dating couples out for a night on the town often went to nightclubs. The man and woman pictured dancing at San Francisco's Forbidden City, which featured Chinese American entertainers, were two of the club's singing stars. By the end of the 1940s, the concept of enjoying the weekend was just another part of American life.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic3f.html", "hero": "d0bdbf0a4ebe136517da3ddedd79b255", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt629019v2", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 28, "fields": {"title": "Dust Bowl Migration", "slug": "dust-bowl-migration", "short_title": "Dust Bowl Migration", "blockquote": "These images show the devastation that drove the Dust Bowl refugees to leave their homes and migrate to California.", "byline": "\"Dust Bowl Migration\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>These images show the devastation that drove the Dust Bowl refugees to leave their homes and migrate to California. They also depict the lives of these families on the road west.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>In 1931, a severe drought hit the Southern and Midwestern plains. As crops died and winds picked up, dust storms began. As the \"Dust Bowl\" photograph shows, crops literally blew away in \"black blizzards\" as years of poor farming practices and over-cultivation combined with the lack of rain. By 1934, 75% of the United States was severely affected by this terrible drought.</p><p>The one-two punch of economic depression and bad weather put many farmers out of business. In the early 1930s, thousands of Dust Bowl refugees \u2014 mainly from Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, Kansas, and New Mexico \u2014 packed up their families and migrated west, hoping to find work. Entire families migrated together (such as the men shown in \"Three generations of Texans now Drought Refugees\") in search of a better life. Images such as\r\n \"Midcontinent \u2014 Family Standing on the Road with Car,\" \"Drought Refugees,\" and \"Untitled, ca. 1935 (Worn-Down Family in Front of Tent)\" offer a glimpse into their experience on the road, and show that cars provided many families both transportation and shelter on the road.</p><p>About 200,000 of the migrants headed for California. The state needed to figure out how to absorb the thousands of destitute people crossing its borders daily. One of their tactics was to document the plight of the refugees. In 1935, photographer Dorothea Lange joined the Rural Rehabilitation Division of the California State Emergency Relief Administration (SERA), a section of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. She was assigned the job of using her camera to document the growing number of homeless Dust Bowl refugees migrating to California. She worked with Paul S. Taylor, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who was researching conditions of rural poverty in order to make recommendations on how to improve the workers' conditions.</p><p>The work by Taylor and Lange played an important role in helping to raise public awareness of the crisis. The reports they made for the government included both data and striking images that revealed the desperate conditions in which the migrants lived and confirmed the need for government intervention. Stark images such as \"Home of Oklahoma Drought Refugees\" resonated with the public, and portraits of drought refugees like \"Ruby from Arkansas\" and others shown in this topic humanized the migrants for more fortunate citizens.

The so-called Great Depression lasted more than a decade, until approximately 1941.

The New Deal created a new role for the federal government, one that involved infusing money into the economy largely through the creation of new jobs and social programs. One photograph shows Roosevelt signing the Social Security Act of 1935, which was designed to keep citizens from becoming destitute.</p><p>The New Deal also created the Works Progress Administration (WPA), which funded artists to create public art projects and others to complete a wide variety of work projects, such as the construction of roads, trails, theaters, and public buildings. Several images show the wide variety of work that the WPA helped fund: an artist painting a mural, a man tending a butterfly collection in the Natural History Museum, and people clipping articles.</p><p>Not everyone supported the government's new, expanded role. The image of men holding a banner that reads \"Against Roosevelt's New Deal\" was taken at a Communist demonstration in San Diego in 1933.</p><p>Still others created their own solution to the Depression's hard times by forming cooperative organizations. The aim of the co-op movement was for people to work together and share the proceeds of their labors. In the early years of the Depression in California, many sorts of self-help cooperatives were formed by individuals (often called \"cooperators\"). The images in this group show cooperative pie-making, sewing and quilting ventures, and a cooperative barber shop, art studio, construction enterprises, and cannery.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic4c.html", "hero": "0799531be2c54dd4f937db6088b03ba8", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/tf087006gk", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 31, "fields": {"title": "San Francisco General Strike", "slug": "san-francisco-general-strike", "short_title": "San Francisco General Strike", "blockquote": "San Francisco\u2019s 1934 General Strike marked the first time a major US port city was completely shut down by a strike--a pivotal episode in the rise of organized labor in the United States.", "byline": "\"San Francisco General Strike\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>The images in this group capture moments from a pivotal episode in the rise of organized labor in the United States: San Francisco\u2019s 1934 General Strike marked the first time a major US port city was completely shut down by a strike. Photographs show picketers, as well as some of the violence that occurred when strikers clashed with police.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Many people who were employed during the Great Depression grew increasingly dissatisfied with working conditions, and took action by forming labor unions. Although the General Strike of San Francisco took place from July 16 to 19, 1934, it had been brewing for months. In March, Harry Bridges (shown in two photographs) led his International Longshoremen\u2019s Association (ILA, which represented the dockworkers), in a vote to strike for control of hiring halls, better pay, and better hours. The ILA strike officially began on May 9, 1934. A photograph from May 8 shows longshoremen waiting for the strike deadline, and an image from May 10 shows Bridges leading picketers down San Francisco\u2019s Embarcadero. Other images show strikers in line for food, and a young man trying to decide whether or not to picket.</p><p>On July 5, when employers tried to open the docks and unload ships, strikers clashed with 1,000 armed police officers. Photographs show police confronting the strikers with what appears to be gunsmoke on one side, and police with tear gas guns. When it was over, 64 were injured and two men were killed on what became known as \"Bloody Thursday.\" The deaths of the men and the huge, public funeral for them (shown in two photographs), helped Bridges rally the support of other unions in the city to join the strike. This General Strike effectively shut down the city of San Francisco for four days. The strike was a success: many of the ILA\u2019s demands were met. A photograph taken in front of the Emporium department store shows a newspaper vendor selling the issue announcing the end of the strike.</p><p>The following year, 1935, the Wagner Act created the National Labor Relations Board that protects the rights of workers to organize into unions.

These images depict the government-funded bridges, dams, and power plants that were built to support the state's growth.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>The large development projects of the 1930s, designed to serve a growing population, helped shape California in many ways. Most are still integral today. Photographs show the progress of two massive Northern California projects: the Golden Gate Bridge, which links San Francisco and Marin County, and the Bay Bridge, which connects San Francisco with Oakland and the East Bay.</p><p>The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the most recognized bridges in the world. It is unique not only because of its vermilion orange color: this steel suspension bridge, with a 4,200-foot-long central span and two towers that are 746 feet tall, is the largest ever built. The photographs in this group, taken between 1933 and 1934, show the various phases of construction from different perspectives, looking down, up, and across the span as it was being built. Some photos also show the workers who helped build this famous structure.</p><p>The Golden Gate Bridge was built under the direction of Joseph Baermann Strauss, an Ohio-born engineer who built more than 400 bridges. The portrait of Strauss also shows the partially built bridge in the background. The Golden Gate Bridge opened to vehicles and pedestrians in 1937.</p><p>The Bay Bridge construction began in 1933, and the span opened to vehicles in 1936. At 8.25 miles, it is the world\u2019s longest steel bridge. The bridge consists of twin suspension bridges. Many of the photos show workers on catwalks with cables and pulleys, building the bridge.</p><p>Growing cities also created greater demands for resources, including electrical power. The building of powerhouses like the Pitt River Power House and the Las Plumas Power House near Oroville, shown here, helped to meet this need.</p><p>Southern California also saw large construction projects. One image in this group shows the San Vicente Dam under construction.</p><p>A few of these images were taken by Jervie Henry Eastman, who established Eastman's Studio in 1921. His photographs were often turned into picture postcards, such as the one of the oil rigs along Ocean Boulevard in Huntington Beach, in 1935.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic4e.html", "hero": "d32abe03b161c62f853e25a801cb8057", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/tf2h4nb6br", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 33, "fields": {"title": "The Great Depression: Everyday Life in Hard Times", "slug": "the-great-depression-everyday-life-in-hard-times", "short_title": "Everyday Life in Hard Times", "blockquote": "Although many people struggled to survive during the Great Depression, these photographs also show that some still found employment, and many managed to enjoy themselves despite the hard economic times.", "byline": "\"The Great Depression: Everyday Life in Hard Times\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2009.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2009, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>The images in this topic provide a look at the everyday lives of Californians during the decade of the 1930s. Although many people struggled to survive during the Great Depression, these photographs also show that some still found employment, and many managed to enjoy themselves despite the hard economic times. </p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Despite the hard economic times of the Great Depression, California did provide work, much of it hard labor. One photograph shows two men working in an oil rig; another shows men using a steam engine and horses to haul logs. The labor crew of the Great Western Salt Works in San Diego, which produced 10% of California\u2019s salt from seawater in 1932, posed for this picture in the late 1920s.</p><p>The state\u2019s rich farming and agriculture industry also provided jobs. Two men stand with a rig to spray pesticides on orchards. Another photograph shows what happened to a citrus orchard when a rare Southern California freeze iced the trees (and ruined the crop) \u2014 an event so seldom seen that these women posed for a picture. On a factory assembly line, scores of women workers pick over fresh peppers to find the best ones for packing. The Cawston Ostrich Farm  supplied a unique product. The South Pasadena farm provided ostrich feathers for hats, boas (long scarves), capes, and fans. Because the Farm  was near a <a href=\"/exhibitions/23/the-rise-of-technology-early-20th-century-california/\">trolley</a>  \r\n line, it became a major tourist attraction where visitors could ride on the backs of ostriches and have their pictures taken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portrait photography, a popular commercial industry since the mid-19th century, was still popular during the Depression. The two images here commemorate the wedding of David and Essie Green in San Bernardino in 1929, and a funeral for the infant son of the Estrada family in Anaheim; they also reflect the state\u2019s growing <a href=\"/exhibitions/24/growing-ethnic-diversity/\">ethnic diversity</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During hard times, people had fun in their free time by finding activities that cost little money. Getting \u201cback to nature,\u201d a pastime encouraged by the development of the <a href=\"/exhibitions/20/preservation-of-the-american-west/\">National Park</a>  system, continued to be a favorite activity. One photograph shows a group around a campfire near Bishop in 1930; another shows a family posing in front of Yosemite\u2019s Wawona Tunnel Tree in 1939.  During the summer, Southern California beaches were popular with swimmers and sunbathers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People enjoyed public celebrations like the May Festival Parade in Orange. In the 1933 photograph shown here, members of the Nichols family ride a bicycle built for four. Beauty contests were also popular. The Miss Anaheim contest, where contestants \u201cswam\u201d in oranges at the City Park Pool, was part of the long-running California Valencia Orange Show.</p><p>And, as today, children played and parents wanted pictures of them doing it. Don and Bill Burtis are shown in a more formal play portrait, in clean clothes and combed hair, \u201ctaking off\u201d in a toy airplane in Sutter County in 1933.  </p><p>Some even had fun at work. The man pictured here on his Harley Davidson in 1933 used his motorcycle in his job with the Highway Patrol in Coalinga, but he was also known to ride around on his bike with his 200-pound pet puma, Oscar.</p><p>For many, however, everyday life was a struggle. Dorothea Lange\u2019s 1936 photograph shows a migrant family of Mexicans on the road with car trouble. And a Los Angeles Daily News photograph taken the same year shows a mother holding her toddler son in their small apartment kitchen in a Los Angeles \u201cslum.\u201d The least fortunate lived in makeshift towns called \u201cHoovervilles,\u201d after the US president blamed for the state of the economy. The man shown here stands next to an outdoor standpipe, this Sacramento Hooverville\u2019s sole water supply. And thousands who couldn\u2019t afford to buy food received government assistance, like the men standing in this \u201cbreadline\u201d at a kitchen on 4th and Jefferson streets in Oakland in 1934.  </p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic4f.html", "hero": "1ebb325a156d510a7dccc097d76336f0", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt8s2029fh", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 34, "fields": {"title": "Women in the Workforce during World War II", "slug": "women-in-the-workforce-during-world-war-ii", "short_title": "Women in the Workforce", "blockquote": "With so many American men involved in the war abroad, there was an extreme shortage of workers at home.

This was an important historical event that many Americans are unaware of today. A bracero (from <i>brazo</i>, the Spanish word for arm) was a Mexican worker allowed entry into the United States for a limited time, usually to work on a farm. In 1942, facing an extreme shortage of farm labor workers due to the war, Congress enacted the Emergency Labor Program. It approved the temporary immigration of thousands of Mexican workers to replace the American men who were in the armed services.

Wartime factory work created new job opportunities, such as building battleships. These photographs, all taken in and around the Richmond Shipyards in Richmond, California, give a sense of what took place at shipyards during World War II.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Industrialist Henry J. Kaiser ran seven shipyards and employed thousands of people. He used an assembly line to build ships, assembling some in less than five days. One image in this collection shows a ship's hull under construction. Another shows a diagram with goals for completing a ship. The workers at the Kaiser shipyards in Richmond, California, produced the most warships in the country during World War II. One photograph shows workers celebrating the launch of one of their ships.</p><p>Kaiser was a forward thinker in terms of employee benefits. As the \"Be a Healthy Shipbuilder\" sign in one of the photographs shows, he was concerned about the welfare of his employees. Kaiser provided his employees with a health care plan by creating the first health maintenance organization, an HMO that exists to this day; and he set up on-site day care centers, where workers could leave their children while they worked their shift.</p><p>Several photographs show the masses of workers who came to work each day, and many show women and minorities working at the Richmond Shipyards. A shortage of male workers and the pressing need for labor (as evidenced by the image of the recruiting billboard), created these new opportunities. This need for workers contributed to the migration to California of African Americans, who came in great numbers from the South in search of job opportunities.</p><p>The many people who streamed into the shipyards in search of work turned Richmond into a boomtown, even attracting national attention. All of the workers needed a place to live, and makeshift living conditions were cramped and uncomfortable.

Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which established 10 internment camps for \"national security\" purposes. Although most internment camps were along the West Coast, others could be found in Wyoming and Colorado, and as far east as Arkansas. One photo shows Japanese American boys in San Francisco shortly before the evacuation order; another shows a woman waiting for the evacuation bus in Hayward; approximately 660 people being evacuated by bus from San Francisco on the first day of the program; and an aerial image of people sitting on their belongings, waiting to be taken to Manzanar.</p><p>The government-sponsored War Relocation Authority (WRA) hired Dorothea Lange and other photographers to take pictures of the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans. Lange\u2019s photographs, some of which were suppressed by the WRA and only released later, often capture the irony inherent in the situation. Although internees were allowed to take only what they could carry with them to the camps, one Lange photo juxtaposes a bus poster \"Such a load off my mind \u2014 Bekins stored my things\" next to a pile of internees' belongings. Another striking Lange image shows a Japanese American-owned corner store with a large \"I am an American\" banner hanging beneath a \"Sold\" sign.</p><p>Another photograph of an engine's distributor, removed from a car owned by an internee, showed that people were truly prisoners at the camp, unable to drive their own cars away. Several paintings by interned Japanese American artists Henry Sugimoto and Hisako Hibi reflect their emotional experiences and give viewers a sense of what life was like for them. The paintings express the pain, suffering, and anger of those subjected to internment.</p><p>Over 100,000 Japanese American men, women, and children were relocated and detained at these camps. Photographs here show people of all ages, including a grandfather and grandchild, and young children. This internment is now recognized as a violation of their human and civil rights.

The 442nd Regimental Combat Team was made up solely of Japanese Americans, some of whom were recruited directly from internment camps. (Some Japanese American men who would later become leaders, such as Senator Daniel Inouye, were members of the 442nd.) The images in this group provide a look at the lives and sacrifices of the men of the 442nd, the most highly decorated American unit in WWII.</p><p>The photographs in this group were all taken for the government-run War Relocation Authority (WRA) and are meant to portray the proud patriotism of the men and their families. One photo shows three women holding their babies, with photographs of their enlisted husbands. Another is a portrait of an older couple who had five sons in the 442nd. Other photographs reflect the training the soldiers of the 442nd received, their life in the battlefield, and their triumphant homecoming.</p><p>Other documents in this group show a more personal side of the men of the 442nd. One soldier's photo album depicts his personal experiences as a member of the combat team. A 50-page booklet, <i>The Story of the 442nd Combat Team</i>, compiled by members of the team, has this quote from Franklin D.

Parker show suburban homes in California in the two decades following World War II. Many appeared in popular house and design magazines of the era. They offered middle\u2013class consumers a new way of living that emphasized a relaxed, low\u2013maintenance, private, indoor\u2013outdoor experience.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>At the end of World War II, many Americans began to move out of the cities and into the suburbs. In response to chronic housing shortages, the federal government offered generous home loans to war veterans, and tax benefits for home ownership. Aggressive building of highway systems and the parallel rise in automobile ownership contributed to the development of communities well beyond urban centers. These and other incentives effectively jump-started the modern era of the single-family suburban home and the suburban revolution.</p><p>As these images illustrate, California was no exception. Between 1950 and 1970, the nation's suburban population doubled (from 36 million to 74 million residents), with 83 percent of the nation's growth in the suburbs. California's abundant land, cheap labor, and mild climate put it in the vanguard of the new housing movement.</p><p>Home and garden magazines such as <i>House Beautiful, Sunset,</i> and <i>House and Garden</i> capitalized on housing trends and provided a blueprint for modern living. Elizabeth Gordon, the powerful and opinionated editor of <i>House Beautiful</i> from 1941 through 1964, urged readers to study the homes seen in her pages for keys to \"better living.\" \"Above all,\" she wrote, \"try to visualize the social values that such a house represents.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photographs here show spacious, light-filled rooms, housewives cooking and husbands barbecuing, a car in the garage, a back yard with a lawn \u2013 and, in some cases, even a swimming pool. These images demonstrate values such as privacy, efficiency, the embrace of new technologies and materials, an informal style of living, and an easy proximity to the outdoors. The postwar suburban residence was portrayed as a refuge from the cares and stresses of the city. It was to be a self-contained world with all the comforts and amenities one could desire and afford.</p><p>In 1946, developer Fritz Burns and the architecture firm of Wurdeman &amp; Becket designed and built a single-family residence in Los Angeles called \"The First Postwar House.\" This model home served as an experimental showcase to display all the desirable hallmarks of suburban living. A one\u2013story U-shaped building facing away from the street, the home had large windows and doors of glass that opened onto several outdoor patios. Labor-saving devices such as dishwashers and freezers, electronic gadgets such as intercoms, and stereo and radio equipment were found throughout the house. Ample closet space and hidden storage compensated for the home's lack of a basement or attic.</p><p>Other designers and builders embraced similar ideas, such as an open floor plan. Cliff May popularized the one-story ranch house. May and others experimented with moveable walls and built-in furnishings for optimal flexibility. Movement between rooms was fluid, and access to the outdoors easy and expected \u2013 even from a bedroom or a bathroom. The informal plan and indoor\u2013outdoor design also enabled homemakers to keep a watchful eye on children while conducting chores. Durable materials like plywood, polished concrete, glass blocks, linoleum, and plastics kept costs down and maintenance low.</p><p>In the past, garages and cars were tucked behind homes away from the street, while people sat out front greeting neighbors. The new suburban house changed that. Several photographs show carports and driveways positioned in front, screening the home from the street and passers-by. A family's domestic life was now conducted out of sight. One article written in 1950, titled \"Good Living is NOT Public Living,\" claimed \"if your neighbors can observe what you are serving on your terrace, your home is not really your castle.\"</p><p>The backyard became a family's private oasis, hidden by fences and hedges and often boasting play spaces for children, swimming pools and barbeque pits, features formerly associated with public parks and community centers. Concrete was used liberally, freeing the suburban homeowner from tedious gardening chores such as mowing. In suburban developments where real estate was at a premium, these spaces often served as extra rooms, particularly in temperate climates. Many commercial photographs of this era show families happily lounging in these settings, seemingly enjoying life to the fullest.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic5g.html", "hero": "11acf629baa3291936eeae027bfc36c0", "lockup_derivative": "618a0ab9a89a8bb0d6fe588fa0c0114e", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt5t1nd9ph", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 41, "fields": {"title": "Everyday Life During World War II", "slug": "everyday-life-during-world-war-ii", "short_title": "Everyday Life", "blockquote": "When the United States entered World War II in 1942, the nation geared up to support the war effort.

After World War II, African Americans \u2014 then often called Negroes or \"coloreds,\" began to mobilize against discrimination. They demanded an end to segregation and fought for equality in education, housing, and employment opportunities.

Images of racial hatred and prejudice are reflected in the photograph of an African American woman holding a rock that had been thrown through an office window, and Klu Klux Klan graffiti spray-painted on a home.</p><p>Various groups formed to fight in the struggle for equal rights. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), formed in 1909, entered a new phase during this period, leading in the organized struggle for civil rights. An example of how the NAACP communicated about events is reflected in a letter from the Alameda County branch of the NAACP on June 13, 1950, which reported segregation on the Southern Pacific Railroad trains leaving Los Angeles. A flyer promoting the boycott of California grapes exemplifies NAACP support for other rights movements, in this case the United Farm Workers. Other flyers urged Californians to fight sharecropper wages and \"Keep Mississippi Out of California.\" Groups such as the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and student groups also protested segregation and incidents of racial discrimination in the South.</p><p>Several important African American leaders \u2014 including Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, Thurgood Marshall, and Ralph Abernathy \u2014 all came to California, as documented by photographs included here. Sometimes, the price of fighting for social justice was high. Two images capture events held for leaders in the social justice movement who were assassinated: the 1963 memorial march in Los Angeles for civil rights leader Medgar Evers; and a crowd attending a Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial Rally in honor of the slain civil rights leader.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic6a.html", "hero": "0993ab7ac1ef4692a2ba77fc9dbaf9bf", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/hb1p30043v/?order=5", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 43, "fields": {"title": "The Free Speech Movement", "slug": "the-free-speech-movement", "short_title": "The Free Speech Movement", "blockquote": "The Free Speech Movement (FSM) was a college campus phenomenon inspired first by the struggle for civil rights and later fueled by opposition to the Vietnam War.", "byline": "\"The Free Speech Movement\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>These images show UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement as it happened.

The Free Speech Movement began in 1964, when students at the University of California, Berkeley protested a ban on on-campus political activities. The protest was led by several students, who also demanded their right to free speech and academic freedom. The FSM sparked an unprecedented wave of student activism and involvement.</p><p>Many images in this group make it clear that the center of the activity on the UC Berkeley campus was in Sproul Plaza.

Photographs taken over several years show the progression: police occupation, burned-out buildings, politicians, and a community looking toward a more hopeful future.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>By the late 1960s, despite the ongoing Civil Rights movement, frustration over poverty, discrimination, injustice, and high unemployment among African Americans helped fuel unrest in many poor, black urban areas. On August 11, 1965, sparked by an angry confrontation between a white police officer and an African American motorcyclist, the Watts neighborhood in Los Angeles erupted in a large-scale civil disorder that lasted for six days and became known as the Watts Riots. Thirty-four people were reported killed, 4,000 were arrested, and 600 buildings were damaged or destroyed. Similar riots erupted in many American cities after Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated in April 1968.</p><p>Recovery from the riots was slow. Photographs taken two months later show a woman and her baby on the sidewalk, in front of rotting furniture; and a young man standing in front of a burned-out store near his home. Other photographs, taken seven months after the riots, reflect the racial tension that remained between police and residents after the riots \u2014 images of armed officers on patrol and officers frisking black suspects for weapons. And another photograph, taken two years later, shows people walking by a row of still-abandoned apartment buildings.</p><p>The riots got the attention of politicians. California Governor Pat Brown (1959\u22121967) and Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty are shown leaving a post-riot conference in March 1966. The people in the Watts community didn't wait for the politicians; they made great efforts at renewal after the riots. Two photographs portray African American girls and boys walking to their summer jobs in Watts. Another image depicts a man handing out shovels and street cleaning supplies to boys ready to help in a clean-up drive.</p><p>The Watts community also attempted to reinvigorate its neighborhood by holding parades and local celebrations. In one image, the Queen of the Watts Christmas Parade waves to the crowd; in another, Roosevelt Grier, a popular professional football player for the Los Angeles Rams, shakes hands with children at the Watts Summer Festival. And boxer Muhammad Ali leads the Watts Summer Festival in an open convertible.

The protests put into motion by the Civil Rights movement evolved to address social justice issues affecting many groups, including students facing the draft, ordinary people protesting the war, farm workers fighting for better working conditions, Chicanos expressing a new identity, and African Americans who felt that nonviolence as a tactic was no longer working.</p><p>America's continued involvement in the Vietnam War galvanized many groups. Across the United States, students protested US involvement in the war by resisting the draft. All sorts of people joined in by disrupting \"business as usual,\" marching, and going on strike. One photograph shows a banner declaring \"On Strike\" hanging over UC Berkeley's Sather Gate; the deserted campus demonstrates widespread support among both faculty and students. Other photographs depict students marching in protest against the war, signing a \"Women for Peace\" petition, and waving an American flag in an anti-war parade.</p><p>The Chicano Moratorium Committee protested the war by marching in parades, but they also registered their own social justice agenda: one photograph shows them carrying banners that read, \"Our fight is in the barrio, not Vietnam.\"</p><p>People also rallied around workers' rights, pushing boundaries and demanding better working conditions. The United Farm Workers (UFW), co-founded and led by Cesar Chavez, used strikes to protest the unfair treatment that California's mainly Mexican field workers received. In one photograph pickets stand at the edge of a Central California grape field and carry placards that say \"Huelga,\" Spanish for \"strike.\" Another photograph shows UFW co-founder Dolores Huerta addressing a group. Groups demanding their rights did not work in isolation; a 1971 letter from Cesar Chavez to the NAACP reflects the support that existed between the two groups, both of which were fighting for equal treatment under the law.</p><p>The Oakland, California-based Black Nationalist organization, the Black Panther Party, was fighting for social justice on several fronts, in a way that often confused their more moderate supporters. They strongly promoted important and positive social issues such as free clinics, programs to feed children, and drug rehabilitation programs; yet, at the same time, they embraced controversial and at times violent tactics. Although Panthers were involved in violent clashes with police, it is still unclear whether the Panthers initiated these actions or were simply defending themselves against police violence directed at them.</p><p>Many of the Panther leaders were persuasive and charismatic speakers, and photographs here show many of them in action: Black Panther Minister of Defense Huey Newton and his wife, Gwen; Black Panther Chairman Bobby Seale in jail; members of the Black Panthers at a press conference; Kathleen Cleaver in a prosecutor's office; and Angela Davis in Los Angeles speaking to the press after a Black Panther shootout. When Huey Newton was put on trial in 1968, accused of murdering a police officer, Black Panthers lined up on the second day of trial to show their support. Another image shows a multiracial crowd gathered at a Huey Newton rally in 1969 at San Francisco's Federal Building.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic6d.html", "hero": "1bf3d199a07fe7b2fcc82628e6334d2b", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/hb8b69p1xc", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 46, "fields": {"title": "Everyday Life from Postwar to Protest", "slug": "everyday-life-from-postwar-to-protest", "short_title": "Everyday Life from Postwar to Protest", "blockquote": "From birthday parties and family meals to homecoming rallies and political protests, these photographs reflect how life looked during the 1950s, 60s, and 70s.", "byline": "\"Everyday Life from Postwar to Protest\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2009.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2009, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The images in this topic provide a glimpse into the daily lives and changing lifestyles of Californians during the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, as the country moved from postwar to protest. From birthday parties and family meals to homecoming rallies and political protests, these photographs reflect how life looked during those years. Two images show Californians interacting with political figures who shaped those decades. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The images from the 1950s reflect family, organizations, and celebrations. Family photos celebrate family moments: A family shares a meal around the kitchen table. Friends roast marshmallows around a campfire. Children pose in front of the Christmas tree at their grandmother\u2019s Anaheim home. Even Vice President Richard M. Nixon (a Whittier native) is shown (in a posed picture) playing the piano for his wife and two daughters. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patriotic community service is another theme shown in some images. In one photograph men and women enjoy a formal dinner at an American Legion post in San Bernardino. In another, a Girl Scout troup prepares a new 50-star American flag in 1959, when Hawaii became the fiftieth state. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On historic Olvera Street in Los Angeles, costumed adults and children celebrate Mardi Gras. And in Fullerton, students sitting on an old \u201cjalopy\u201d celebrate Homecoming (<a href=\"/exhibitions/59/hispanic-americans-cultural-traditions-and-the-people-1930s-1960s/\">see more images from Olvera Street</a>) </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1960s brought more change. In 1960, the year Velia Juarez and Albert Varela were married in Corona, the national presidential elections were in full swing. Ted Kennedy campaigned for his brother, Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy, in Oxnard. Three years later, shopper in San Francisco\u2019s Emporium watch department store TVs in shock as news anchor Walter Cronkite reports President Kennedy\u2019s assassination in Dallas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1964, the Beatles performed at San Francisco\u2019s Cow Palace. One news photograph shows members of the Beatles Fan Club voicing their excitement in Union Square. The same year, high school seniors all over California (like the San Bernardino couple shown here) were photographed at their proms. And everyday life\u2014birthday parties, childhood friends, Boy Scout hikes\u2014continued to be documented in family snapshots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the late 1960s, <a href=\"/exhibitions/45/struggles-for-social-justice/\">social protests</a> were in the news. California, like the rest of the nation, was deeply split by the war in Vietnam. <span lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">One photograph from the San Mateo Public Library shows a   ceremony in Vietnam honoring soldiers who died in   the war.</span>  Another shows Christian anti-war protesters singing on the steps of UC Berkeley\u2019s Sproul Hall. A news clipping shows Brownie Troop 1202 sending pudding cups to San Mateo's adopted sons, the men of Company A, 101st Airborne Battalion, the Screaming Eagles, in Vietnam. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the 1970s began, the photographs show female secretaries working for the City of San Bernardino, a high school sewing class with no male students, and young women competing in beauty pageants. Women\u2019s rights and traditional gender roles were being actively questioned and defended as proponents tried (and failed) to pass the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) into law. One photograph shows ERA demonstrators at Reagan's headquarters. Another shows a young African American girl at the <a href=\"/exhibitions/44/watts-rebellion/\">Watts</a> Summer Festival holding a balloon that proclaims \u201cI am somebody.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The suburbs continued to grow, as shown by this advertisement for the planned community of Mission Viejo in Orange County, promoting a small-town lifestyle. And the daily lives of California\u2019s multicultural population continued to be documented in photographs: the Lee family enjoys a Thanksgiving dinner, Morningside High\u2019s pep squad members pose for the camera, and Danny Flores and his wife pose next to their decorated 1952 Chevrolet. In 1976, Californians\u2014like the costumed women shown cutting a huge cake\u2014celebrated the nation\u2019s bicentennial. </p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/themed_collections/subtopic6e.html", "hero": "2143e4d004504049221f9ac6193eaddb", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt738nd5dg", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 47, "fields": {"title": "African Americans: Gold Rush Era to 1900", "slug": "african-americans-gold-rush", "short_title": "Gold Rush Era to 1900", "blockquote": "The Gold Rush Era marked the real beginning of African American migration into California.", "byline": "\"African Americans: Gold Rush Era to 1900\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005 as part of the <a href=\"/cal-cultures\">California Cultures</a> project.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>A small number of Afro-Latinos and other Africans arrived in California before the Gold Rush. A few were a part of the early explorations. A few others, like entrepreneur Williams Leidesdorrf, came to seek their fortunes. The biracial Leidesdorff came to California from the Virgin Islands in 1841. By 1844, he was a major San Francisco (then called Yerba Buena) landowner and later became the city's US Vice Consul.</p><h3>The Gold Rush Era</h3><p>The Gold Rush Era marked the real beginning of African American migration into California. About 200 to 300 slaves came to work the gold fields, followed by free African Americans. As the Daguerreotype of miners at Spanish Flat illustrates, black and white miners worked side by side.</p><p>In 1850, when California joined the United States as a free state, the census showed California with 962 black residents. Many former slaves gained their freedom, but lack of government oversight allowed slavery to flourish in certain regions. In 1852, a fugitive slave law made it illegal for slaves to flee their masters within California's supposedly free borders. All African Americans in California \u2014 born free or formerly enslaved \u2014 lived under a constant threat of arrest.</p><p>Nonetheless, as indicated by the political cartoon \"Difficult Problems Solving Themselves,\" African Americans continued to move West. They came not only from the Deep South, but from Virginia, New York, and Massachusetts. By 1852, they numbered 2,000 \u2014 about 1 percent of California's population.</p><h3>Struggling for Rights</h3><p>During the mid-19th century, even \"free\" African Americans in California were barred from testifying in court or sending their children to public schools. In 1855, Mifflin Wistar Gibbs, an African American abolitionist who had spent years lecturing with Frederick Douglass, helped organize the First State Convention of Colored Citizens of California to fight for suffrage and equal rights.</p><p>Despite their lack of equal rights, African Americans served in the military during and after the Civil War. Included here is an image of an African American in a Union uniform during the early 1860s; an 1899 photograph shows Buffalo Soldiers from the 24th Mounted Infantry in Yosemite.</p><p>African Americans won the right to testify in California in 1863; but the right to vote came only with the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870. The 1867 lithograph \"The Reconstruction Policy of Congress, As Illustrated in California,\" shows the struggle African Americans faced in being taken seriously as voters: they are reduced to a caricature in this political cartoon, along with Chinese Americans and Native Americans.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic1a.html", "hero": "680249543d1fe90cf4ec5b48ba5ffb75", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt4s2020jg", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 48, "fields": {"title": "African Americans: The Struggle for Economic Equality, 1900-1950s", "slug": "african-americans-economic-equality", "short_title": "The Struggle for Economic Equality, 1900-1950s", "blockquote": "In the first half of the 20th century, many African Americans struggled for economic equality amidst discriminatory attitudes and policies.", "byline": "\"African Americans: The Struggle for Economic Equality, 1900-1950s\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005 as part of the <a href=\"/cal-cultures\">California Cultures</a> project.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>African Americans made up less than 2 percent of California's population in the decades before World War I, numbering about 7,800 in 1900. Despite their small numbers, they maintained a sense of community through memberships in the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) and organizations such as W. E. B. DuBois's National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Urban League, and the California Association of Colored Women's Clubs. In other parts of the country, African Americans such as Booker T. Washington, head of Alabama's Tuskegee Institute, were making inroads into education.</p><h3>The Struggle for Economic Equality (1900-1950s)</h3><p>Most African Americans lived in California's growing urban centers. Racial discrimination often relegated them to low-paying service jobs, such as the men in Anaheim's street corner shoeshine business or the chauffeur standing behind Edith Story and her automobile. But the 1907 photograph of businessmen, which commemorates the 13th annual meeting of Oakland's Afro-American Council, demonstrates the ongoing presence of a black middle class.</p><p>Some black entrepreneurs \u2014 including several women \u2014 managed to find financial success through hard work and good fortune. Former slave Biddy Mason used the money she earned as a nurse to invest in Los Angeles real estate, becoming a wealthy philanthropist and founding the First AME Church. Mary Ellen Pleasant, another former slave, ran several businesses and restaurants in San Francisco and used her resources to fight for African American civil rights.</p><p>African Americans were also part of the popular culture, although their participation was often segregated. A 1923 photograph shows baseball player \"Bullet\" Hilary Meaddows of Oakland's Colored Giants, a team in the Negro Leagues. A 1926 photograph shows African American musicians, the Hartzog Radio Night Hawks, just one of many such jazz bands of the 1920s.</p><p>Despite some notable success stories, most African Americans found it difficult to break out of the \"traditional\" occupations of domestic work and manual labor. This situation began to change as the United States entered World War I, and they found work in war-related industries.</p><h3>War Brings Change (1940s-1950s)</h3><p>At the end of World War I, immigration from outside the United States was largely curtailed, cutting off the flow of new workers to industry and contributing to the \"Great Migration\" of African Americans from the South to industrial centers in the North.</p><p>World War II brought more change. As one photograph shows, African Americans enlisted in the military, and they also moved up the blue collar ladder to careers such as firefighting. In both the armed forces and the fire department, they served in segregated units, as the photograph of Oakland's Engine Company 22 shows. Again, as after World War I, African Americans migrated to California in large numbers. They found work in war industries, including shipping, as illustrated by the photographs of workers at the Richmond Shipyards.</p><p>Many of these migrants came to Los Angeles. Ironically, as illustrated by the 1943 photographed captioned \"Wartime housing in Little Tokyo's Bronzeville,\" a number of newcomers found housing in former Japanese American neighborhoods \u2014 in homes and apartments left vacant when residents were incarcerated in internment camps. Chester Himes's 1945 novel, <i>If He Hollers Let Him Go</i>, exposed the racial discrimination faced by many black migrants in wartime Los Angeles. Racist real estate policies, including restrictive covenants, limited their ability to move out of segregated urban neighborhoods. Discrimination restricted their access to skilled and professional jobs as well as to higher education. As they returned home from the fight against fascism in Europe, many African American veterans saw the struggle for civil rights at home as an issue that needed to be addressed.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic1b.html", "hero": "1df9b6d5136f9ad3a511fad2cf2c95e3", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/tf3489p0qx", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 49, "fields": {"title": "African Americans: Civil Rights and Social Reform, 1950s-1970s", "slug": "african-americans-civil-rights", "short_title": "Civil Rights and Social Reform, 1950s-1970s", "blockquote": "From the 1950s through the 1970s, movements for civil and social rights, equality, and justice swept the United States.", "byline": "\"African Americans: Civil Rights and Social Reform, 1950s-1970s\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005 as part of the <a href=\"/cal-cultures\">California Cultures</a> project.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>By the 1950s, African Americans began to mobilize in earnest against discrimination. As the 1957 photograph makes clear, even baseball legend Willie Mays was touched by housing discrimination. They lived in the same culture as white Americans \u2014 as illustrated by the photographs of Oakland's McClymonds High School marching band and the group of young woman at an NAACP-sponsored social event \u2014 and they wanted to enjoy equal rights.</p><h3>The Struggle for Civil Rights (1950s-1960s)</h3><p>Civil rights groups demanded an end to segregation. They fought for equality in education, housing, and employment opportunities, and they made some headway. White-collar and professional sector jobs began to open up for African Americans, as shown by the photograph of commercial artist Berry Weeks working at his draft board in 1960. But not all white Americans welcomed change.</p><p>From the 1950s through the 1970s, movements for civil and social rights, equality, and justice swept the United States. As the photograph of a civil rights rally at San Jose State College (now SJSU) shows, the movement wasn't limited to African Americans but also drew from the white community. As the movement gained ground, however, it created a backlash of racism in many parts of the country, including California. The 1963 photograph documenting a cross burning on the lawn of a black family in San Francisco's Ingleside district in 1963 shows clearly that this backlash was not limited to the Deep South.</p><p>Most civil rights protests of this time were peaceful, as illustrated by two photographs taken in San Francisco in 1963: picketers protesting unfair hiring practices at Mel's Diner, and a march for civil rights on Market Street. Civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr., and Ralph Abernathy, pictured here, advocated these nonviolent protests. But others, such as Black Muslim leader Malcolm X, were less patient with the process, foreshadowing the harder-edged protests to come.</p><p>In 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. By February 1965, Malcolm X had also been killed. Later that year, anger and desperation fueled by years of discriminatory practices and police brutality exploded into violence in the Los Angeles African American neighborhood of <a href=\"/exhibitions/44/watts-rebellion/\">Watts</a>. The violence \u2014 triggered by the arrest of a black motorcyclist by white police \u2014 was the most destructive urban uprising in US history at that time. The woman shown standing outside her apartment was just one of many people affected. The riots lasted a week, involved more than 10,000 people, and left at least 34 dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The violence shocked the nation and left the community in disarray. But over the next few years the citizens of Watts pulled together to rebuild their neighborhood. Parades demonstrated their newfound civic pride. One photograph shows former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali (newspapers still called him Cassius Clay) riding in a convertible as Grand Marshall of the Watts Summer Festival in 1967; another shows the Queen of the Watts Christmas Parade in 1968.</p><h3>Social Reform (1960s-1970s)</h3><p>The violence in California and elsewhere in the country seemed to culminate with the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., in April 1968. Memorials were held across the nation, including the one in the San Francisco Bay Area pictured here. A new subject, diversity \u2014 called \"Negro History\" in these early years \u2014 began to be taught in schools, as illustrated by the photograph taken at Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles.</p><p>At the same time, the ongoing Vietnam War reached into every community. This 1968 photograph shows San Francisco State College students waiting to hear if their draft number will be called in the draft lottery. After King's death the urgency for a different kind of protest emerged. African American anger was building, and movements for liberation and revolution (such as Black Power and Black Nationalism) gained momentum, usurping the role of traditional civil rights politics that focused on integration.</p><p>The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was founded in Oakland by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale in 1966. By 1968, Newton, the party's Minister of Defense, was on trial for murder. One photograph shows Black Panthers protesting outside the courthouse, giving the black power salute. Another shows Panthers Communications Secretary Kathleen Cleaver, wife of author Eldridge Cleaver, talking to the prosecution. Newton fled to Cuba, but returned in 1977 (shown here) and was acquitted.</p><p>Bobby Seale was arrested in 1968 as part of the Chicago Eight protest at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago that year, and again for murder two years later. Like Newton, he too was acquitted. The \"Intercommunal Day of Solidarity\" poster rallied support for a number of so-called political prisoners, including Seale, Newton, and Angela Davis (another Panther arrested for murder and acquitted). Davis, who later became a history of consciousness professor at UC Santa Cruz, is shown speaking to students at UCLA in 1970. Despite the deaths and arrests of leaders, the Black Panther Party was still active in 1969, as the photograph of Southern California Panther leaders at a press conference shows.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic1c.html", "hero": "3355b0b1ca33024468b95c7ea1ad37c1", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/tf029006qw", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 50, "fields": {"title": "African Americans: Politics and Community, 1970s-Present", "slug": "african-americans-politics-community", "short_title": "Politics and Community, 1970s-Present", "blockquote": "In the early 1970s,  the ideals the Black Panthers had fought for were taking hold in the community.

By the early 1970s the Panthers had lost momentum, and so had their call for revolution. A 1971 photograph shows Muhammad Ali speaking to UCLA students about a broader range of topics: boxing, alcohol, narcotics, and his Black Muslim faith, in addition to the Black Panthers.</p><h3>Social Change Takes Hold</h3><p>Meanwhile, the ideals the Panthers had fought for were taking hold in the community. African American politicians like California State Assemblyman Willie Brown (shown surrounded by students) were elected and reelected to public office. In 1978, Mervyn Dymally was the Lieutenant Governor of California. The voices of black artists like poet and author Maya Angelou were being heard. And African American entrepreneurs were operating businesses from day care centers to markets.</p><p>Building on this platform of progress, African Americans in the late 1970s pressed for more social change. A 1977 photograph shows a march for jobs and housing in Los Angeles on Martin Luther King Day, one of a number of similar marches across the country. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed the Humphrey Hawkins Bill, aimed at providing \"full employment\" for everyone.</p><p>By the 1980s, Martin Luther King, Jr., had become a historic figure and a hero. Across the nation, the names of streets \u2014 like Santa Barbara Avenue in Los Angeles \u2014 were changed to honor him. The man shown in the photograph, Celes King III, was himself an American hero: the founder of Congress for Racial Equality of California (CORE-CA), longtime president of the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP, and a pilot in the famous all-Negro Tuskegee Airman Squadron during World War II.</p><h3>Rebellion Against Social Conditions</h3><p>At the same time, crime was becoming an issue in the African American community. Photographs show Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Braithwaite Burke speaking against fraud to a homeowner's association; and another photograph, taken in 1983, shows residents in South Central Los Angeles demonstrating against crime in their neighborhood.</p><p>In 1992, violence erupted in South Central after the acquittal of several white police officers for the beating of black motorist Rodney King. Millions of dollars of damage were done and the lives of many residents were affected. The \"Rodney King uprising\" has also been called the first multiethnic riot because it included Hispanic Americans and Korean Americans as well as African Americans. Many choose to call these events a \"rebellion\" against social and economic conditions in the inner city, rather than a \"riot,\" which only emphasizes the violence. This reoccurrence of urban violence surprised many who believed the Civil Rights movement had improved conditions for California's African Americans. Some have noted that although political gains had been made over the years, continuing economic inequalities contributed to escalating tension. The underlying causes of the Watts uprising \u2014 underemployment, poverty, segregation, and police harassment \u2014 persisted almost 30 years later.</p><h3>Political and Social Change Today</h3><p>Nonetheless, the activism, entrepreneurship, and government programs of the 1970s-90s did foster the emergence of a sizeable black middle class in California. A number of African American politicians won important offices, including Thomas Bradley (five-term mayor of Los Angeles), Willie L. Brown, Jr. (State Assemblyman and two-term mayor of San Francisco), and US representatives Augustus Hawkins, Yvonne Braithewaite Burke, Ronald Dellums, Julian Carey Dixon, Mervyn Dymally, Barbara Lee, Juanita Millender-McDonald, and Maxine Waters.</p><p>Today, upwardly mobile African Americans have moved from the urban centers of Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco into suburbs and the Central Valley and their ability to work together to elect local black politicians has actually weakened. As their voting bloc has dispersed, Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans have grown in numbers and their political power in the state is rising.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic1d.html", "hero": "0187fe8398dcd54302237f1f39ed4e47", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/hb1q2nb0fd", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 51, "fields": {"title": "African Americans: Community Life, 1950s-1980s", "slug": "african-americans-community-life", "short_title": "Community Life, 1950s-1980s", "blockquote": "The images in this exhibition provide a glimpse into the daily lives and changing lifestyles of African Americans in California between the 1950s and the early 1980s.", "byline": "\"African Americans: Community Life, 1950s-1980s\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2009 as part of the <a href=\"/cal-cultures\">California Cultures</a> project.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2009, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p> The images in this topic provide a glimpse into the daily lives and changing lifestyles of African Americans in California between the 1950s and the early 1980s.

In 1969, two boys play ball in the ruins of Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, home of the old Angels team.</p><p>Although most of the images are of everyday people\u2014in school, at a beauty pageant, doing community service, attending political rallies, taking art classes, going fishing, dancing, and just hanging out with friends\u2014some show well-known African American celebrities in the context of community activities: LA Lakers basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar interacts with fans in 1980. Boxer Muhammad Ali is shown walking with a group of young people in the early 1970s, and riding in a car at San Bernardino\u2019s Black History Parade in 1980. Singer Harry Belafonte is pictured rehearsing for a show at the Greek Theater; in another image, his wife, Marguerite, raises funds for the NAACP. Jazz legend Duke Ellington is shown surrounded by students and teachers at Washington Elementary School in Berkeley during a 1969 visit.</p><p>The community also came out to celebrate the victory of political leaders like Mayor Tom Bradley, shown here with then-Governor Jerry Brown. Bradley was the first and only African American mayor of Los Angeles, and his 20-year tenure was also the longest of any LA mayor.</p><p>Beginning in the 1960s and 70s, \r\n<a href=\"/exhibitions/42/the-civil-rights-movement/\">the Civil Rights Movement</a> and <a href=\"/exhibitions/43/the-free-speech-movement/\"> the Free Speech Movement</a> encouraged people to participate in political actions and community organizing activities. One photograph shows a crowd marching up San Francisco\u2019s Market Street in support of civil rights. Another shows anti-Vietnam discussions at Oakland\u2019s Lake Merritt Park in 1965. In 1964, a group of marchers representing Youth for Service is shown protesting an assault on an Asian store owner in their community. A photograph taken the previous year shows the group removing rocks from Hunter\u2019s Point in San Francisco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1968, three years after the destruction caused by the <a href=\"/exhibitions/44/watts-rebellion/\">Watts Riots</a>, the community began to reinvigorate itself culturally and politically. Here, a man is shown with children at the Watts Summer Festival in the early 1970s.

And according to Eloisa Gomez Borah, \u201cManila men were reported to have been the major population\u201d of one of the earliest gold camps in Mariposa County. Most of the Asian miners and immigrants during the Gold Rush Era, however, were Chinese.</p><h3>Gold Rush Era</h3><p>After 1851, Chinese gold seekers arrived in California in great numbers. Soon, they comprised about a fifth of the entire population in mining areas. The lithograph shows Chinese miners working a claim; and a photograph by Eadweard Muybridge shows a prospector panning for gold in a river in 1852. The title of this photograph is \u201cThe Heathen Chinee.\u201d Twenty years later, Bret Harte wrote the lyrics to a song of the same title (shown here in sheet music), reflecting the mistrust of California\u2019s white population toward the Chinese immigrants.</p><p>Nonetheless, Chinese men continued to come to California. The lithograph \u201cChinese emigration to America\u201d shows a below-decks dinner scene on the San Francisco-bound steamship Alaska. Men are crowded around a wok, eating freshly cooked food. A wicker basket seems to hold rice.</p><p>Many Chinese immigrants earned a living by working claims abandoned by other miners. They also took jobs as cooks, launderers, merchants, and herbalists, hoping to return to China with a small fortune. A song from San Francisco's Chinatown expressed this desire: \u201cI am returning home with purses and bags stuffed full. Soon I will see my parents' brows beaming with joy.\u201d However, low pay, discriminatory hiring practices, and the monthly foreign miners' license tax made this goal all but impossible.</p><p>Some Chinese Californians challenged American racism by organizing unions, as well as through the legal system and in the court of public opinion. Chinese community leaders petitioned Sacramento to overturn unfair laws and worked to gain the right to testify in court (finally granted in 1872). Norman Asing, a restaurant owner in San Francisco's booming Chinatown, wrote to California governor John Bigler in a 1852 issue of the Daily Alta California insisting, \u201cWe are not the degraded race you would make us.\u201d(<a href=\"http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6561/\">\u201cTo His Excellency Gov. Bigler,\"</a> in Daily Alta California (San Francisco: May 5, 1852).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the many difficulties involved in completing the transcontinental railroad was the problem of finding laborers willing to take on the dangerous, back-breaking work. In 1865, the Central Pacific Railroad turned to Chinese workers, who soon comprised two-thirds of the railroad's labor force. Most of the approximately 10,000 Chinese railroad laborers came directly from China, joining thousands of their countrymen already in California from the Gold Rush era. A photograph shows a Chinese man carrying water for construction; and a lithograph shows \u201cMingling of European with Asiatic Laborers\u201d on the last mile of the Pacific Railroad.</p><h3>Discrimination and Violence</h3><p>By the 1870s, Chinese Californians faced discrimination and outright violence. An economic downturn during this decade heightened job competition and encouraged anti-Chinese xenophobia.</p><p>\u201cThe First Blow at the Chinese Question,\u201d a political cartoon from The Illustrated Wasp, shows a white worker punching a Chinese man. So-called \"anti-coolie clubs\" formed throughout the state (even though the Chinese weren\u2019t \u201ccoolies,\u201d a term referring to those coerced or deceived into migration, or indentured servants) to denounce Chinese immigration. White mobs attacked Chinese communities up and down California, climaxing in an all-out assault on San Francisco's Chinatown in 1877. Another political illustration from The Wasp shows a kitten labeled \u201cChinese cheap labor\u201d growing up to be a tiger that kills everyone in its path.</p><p>California politicians buckled to this mounting pressure and helped pass <a href=\"/exhibitions/17/chinese-exclusion-act/\">The Chinese Exclusion Act</a> in 1882. This federal ban on Chinese immigration was the first such law in US history to explicitly exclude a group of people based on their race.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Daily Life</h3><p>Despite this restriction on immigration, Chinese communities continued to thrive. San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown is shown in a variety of images: men on Dupont Street, now Grant Street, are shown in the late 1880s; an 1888 photograph taken near Portsmouth Square in Chinatown shows a cable car going up the street, which is filled with men. Robert F. Blum\u2019s painting of a street corner in Chinatown shows a more festive scene, with women and children.</p><p>Few women immigrated to the United States, as the labor market demanded men for manual labor. Although the majority of Chinese migrants at this time were men, there was also family life. The photograph of \u201cChinese Public School Children\u201d (c. 1890) shows a group of boys in traditional Chinese clothing; the \u201cChildren of High Class\u201d are also dressed traditionally. In the photograph of vegetable peddlers, a woman bends over to choose something from a basket. And a photograph taken in Golden Gate Park in the 1990s shows a family group sitting on a park bench. The group portrait of a Chinese family in Anaheim was taken in 1892. Most of the Chinese in this area worked as laborers or sold produce.</p><h3>Japanese Migration </h3><p>Until 1884, Japanese laborers could not legally migrate. Nonetheless, Japanese settlers first began migrating to California in the late 1860s. By 1870, 33 of the 55 Japanese in the United States lived in California. By 1880, 86 Japanese lived in California.</p><p>In 1884, Japan began allowing people to migrate to Hawaii to work in the sugar plantations. Six years later, many had moved on to California, bringing the state\u2019s Japanese population up to 1, 114 \u2014 about half of the total of Japanese living in the United States. Most of these immigrants\u2014the vast majority of whom were men\u2014probably worked as laborers.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic2a.html", "hero": "50142330e961ab02de45b85efa1936cd", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/tf2v19p0s7", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 53, "fields": {"title": "Asian Americans: Early 20th Century", "slug": "asian-americans-early-20th-century", "short_title": "Early 20th Century", "blockquote": "Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Korean, and Filipino Americans established communities in California despite exclusionary laws and descrimination.", "byline": "\"Asian Americans: Early 20th Century\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005 as part of the <a href=\"/cal-cultures\">California Cultures</a> project.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>With immigration from China cut off, those Chinese already in California became increasingly marginalized. They struggled to maintain dignity and financial stability in the face of racist boycotts, discriminatory hiring practices, and threats of mob violence.</p><h3>Chinese American Life</h3><p>In 1906, the great San Francisco earthquake and subsequent fire destroyed birth and immigration records, allowing many Chinese to claim American birth and thus citizenship. Because the Chinese Exclusion Act allowed the children of citizens to migrate, many Chinese men migrated as \"paper sons.\" Not actually related, they claimed kinship on paper only.</p><p>As a result of those practices, in 1910, the Angel Island detention facility in San Francisco Bay began to detain and interrogate Chinese immigrants. Over the next 30 years, approximately 175,000 were incarcerated and held, some for up to two years. A photograph shows the examination in the main building of this facility. The detention center was finally abandoned in 1940.</p><p>Throughout the early 20th century, Chinese Americans continued to put down roots in their communities. Photographs from the time show businesses thriving: the shelves of San Francisco's Sam Hop Company are filled and stacked to the ceiling; a merchant has an abacus to do his accounts; and restaurateur Tom Mah \u2014 the inventor of chop suey \u2014 poses In Los Angeles' Chinatown. They also show family life: a man proudly holds a baby (perhaps his grandchild), and children ride bicycles.</p><h3>Japanese American Life</h3><p>California\u2019s Japanese American population also faced prejudice, which culminated in an unofficial US-Japanese agreement in 1907-08 to slow or stop the flow of immigrants from Japan. The exception was wives and children of the men who had already migrated.</p><p>Since most issei (Japanese Americans born in Japan) were single men when they immigrated, it was not uncommon for them to find wives through correspondence and the exchange of photographs. Many issei women came to the United States as \u201cpicture brides.\u201d In 1924, the United States passed a law barring further immigration of Japanese women, evidently to discourage the establishment of families and communities of Japanese Americans. Henry Sugmimoto\u2019s 1965 painting Stop Picture Bride refers to this time. The 1924 emigration papers for one young woman, identified here as Frank Hirahara's mother, suggest she may have been among the last picture brides.</p><p>Despite laws preventing land ownership, the Japanese American population established homes, churches, and businesses. Mr. and Mrs. Tagawa, their daughter and a man are shown at work in the Hanford laundry business they started in 1910. A portrait of Kumakichi Takeoka is inset over the photograph of his farm in Florin.</p><p>In addition to labor jobs with the railroads, in the fields, and in domestic jobs, they established their own enterprises in fishing and agriculture, particularly in Central California. A plaque commemorates the Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Farm Colony, the first agricultural settlement of pioneer Japanese immigrants. One photograph shows Japanese American farm women wearing bonnets and long dresses in 1915; another shows Japanese workers among a very diverse group of farmworkers. A playful photo shows a man identified as Mr. Kawada riding a bicycle in a field in Elk Grove.</p><p>By 1910, there were 41,356 Japanese residents and Japanese Americans in California (<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/5views/5views.htm\">\"Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California\"</a> published by the National Parks Service). A home in Coronado, in an 1895 photograph, shows a distinct Japanese influence. Photographs \u2014 like those of Mary Hirahara\u2019s mother, the Taketa family, Walter Tsukamoto and his family, and Florin\u2019s baseball team \u2014 show Japanese Americans firmly entrenched in American middle-class society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, most of the population had been in San Francisco and Northern California because San Francisco was the major point of entry to the United States. However, several factors \u2014 including the 1906 earthquake and fire, laws preventing land ownership, and the fall of agricultural prices after WWI\u2014caused many Japanese Americans to migrate to cities, particularly Los Angeles, which is still home to a vibrant Little Tokyo.</p><h3>Immigration from India</h3><p>In the early part of the 20th century, small numbers of Punjabi migrants from India came to Central California as farmers. One photograph shows \u201cHindu\u201d laborers in a field on San Joaquin Island; another shows their housing conditions.</p><p>After 1917, pressured by labor interest groups, Congress barred immigration from India. Due to a gender imbalance in the Indian community, a good number of the Punjabi farmers in California\u2019s Imperial Valley married local Mexican women. A photograph from 1910 shows a turbaned man identified as Indian or South Asian sitting with another man on a wooden sidewalk in San Francisco. In 1921, San Francisco\u2019s \"Hindoo\" (Hindu) Temple was the only one in the United States. The photograph of Mary Singh Rai and her mother, Ernestine Singh, was taken in the 1930s.</p><h3>Korean Immigration</h3><p>Beginning at the turn of the 20th century, a handful of Korean laborers, students, and expatriate intellectuals migrated to California. For over 20 years, a Presbyterian mission in Los Angeles\u2019 Bunker Hill neighborhood was a focal point for the community. Because Japan began a colonial occupation of Korea in 1910 and afterward, exclusionary immigration and land ownership laws that targeted Japanese also affected the lives of Koreans in the United States.</p><h3>Filipino Immigration</h3><p>At first, Filipinos freely migrated to the United States because the American conquest of the Philippines in 1902 granted them \u201cUS national\u201d status. The 1920s saw a huge influx of Filipinos into California, mainly in response to the need for agricultural workers following the exclusion of Chinese and Japanese. Photographs show some of these men at work, and in their workers\u2019 camps.</p><p>By 1930, more than half of the Filipinos in the United States lived in California. Many of them were brought in as strike-breakers, which led to racial tensions, especially with Mexican and whites, who perceived them as taking away work. Threatening letters like the one shown here warned of violence to come.</p><p>In 1929, tensions erupted into violence in Exeter, California, when a mob attacked a Filipino camp. More riots and violence followed in San Jose, San Francisco, and Watsonville, where conflict arose not only from labor competition, but also because local European Americans were opposed to Filipinos dating white women.</p><p>The vast majority of Filipinos were male seasonal or migratory laborers. Well-dressed men (but no women) pose in front of the Manila Pool Hall; and the group photograph of the Lapog Sons of San Jose shows only a few women among all the men. The lack of Filipino women, and the families that would result, meant there was never a \u201cLittle Manila\u201d or \u201cFilipinotown\u201d as strong as the Chinatowns or Little Tokyos in Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Nevertheless, Filipino migrants often founded fraternal and other community organizations like the Lapog Sons to provide spaces for social interaction, sometimes a rotating loan system, and a network for news about available jobs).</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic2b.html", "hero": "cf098dc05fc1102544d6dce615802a18", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt267nc3qt", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 54, "fields": {"title": "Asian Americans: World War II", "slug": "asian-americans-world-war-ii", "short_title": "World War II", "blockquote": "By 1940, people from many different ethnic and racial groups had settled in California.

A set of maps show the distribution of racial and national groups in the greater Los Angeles area, based on the 1940 US census. Asian groups listed include Japanese, Filipino, and \u201cforeign born from Asia.\u201d A news photo taken shortly before Pearl Harbor shows a diverse group of chefs at a Los Angeles restaurant \u2014 a Filipino, a Japanese American, and a Chinese American. According to the caption, \"And they get along too.\"</p><h3>During the War</h3><p>As the century progressed, Japanese Americans became established in industries related to growing and selling produce and flowers. By the time of the US entry into World War II, these industries were thriving, and many Japanese Americans had entered the middle class.</p><p>After the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, however, the federal government rounded up and relocated 120,000 Californians of Japanese descent in the name of national security. Dorothea Lange took the photograph of farm families boarding an evacuation bus in Centerville, carrying parcels (evacuees were only allowed to take what possessions they could carry). Two-thirds of the Japanese Americans were actually American born, and thus citizens. Most were incarcerated in 10 remote and guarded \u201crelocation camps\u201d for more than two years, despite never being convicted \u2014 or even formally accused \u2014 of a crime. Conditions were bleak in the camps: a photograph shows a man resting on a cot after moving his possessions into a cramped room; and a painting by internee artist Estelle Ishigo portrays a family at home in the camps. To prove their loyalty and patriotism, many men joined the segregated all-Japanese American <a href=\"/exhibitions/39/the-442nd-regimental-combat-team/\">442nd Regimental Combat Team</a>, the most decorated military unit in American history. <a href=\"/exhibitions/t11/jarda/\">See more images of Japanese American internment.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Americans were well aware of the virulent racism made worse by war with Japan. As the photograph illustrates, some wore buttons that read \u201cI am Chinese\u201d to distinguish themselves from Japanese. Given China\u2019s ally status, Chinese Americans suffered less discrimination than Japanese. Many Chinese joined the military. A photograph of Chinatown\u2019s American Legion post shows veterans of World Wars I and II. Like other American women during the war-based labor shortage, Chinese American women worked on the home front \u2014 illustrated here by a woman on a construction site.</p><p>In 1943, Congress passed the Magnuson Act, which repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act. The reasons were twofold: the United States sought out China as an ally during WWII, and also sought to deflect Japanese propaganda in Asia that called the United States a racist country for its exclusionary and segregationist practices. Due to provisions of the Magnuson Act and a later War Brides Act, Chinese Americans were able to bring wives to America, beginning a new generation.</p><p>Approximately 250,000 Filipino men joined the US armed forces to fight in World War II. Anacieto Soriano, Sr. (at right) and his friend are shown wearing their 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment uniforms. But after the war, President Truman signed the Recission Act of 1946, effectively erasing their service records and denying them military benefits. Many of these California veterans live in near poverty today. As of mid-2007, S. 57, The Filipino Veterans Equity Act of 2007, has not been voted on.</p><h3>Postwar Life</h3><p>Upon release at the end of the war, many Japanese Americans found themselves destitute, stripped of their homes, possessions, and businesses, forced to begin again to build lives in the United States.</p><p>Recognizing the injustice of the relocation campaigns, the US Congress made partial reparations to Japanese Americans in 1948. Years later, after intense lobbying by community activists, Congress passed the 1988 Civil Liberties Act. It mandated a formal apology, $20,000 compensation for former internees, and the creation of a fund to educate the public about the camps and the unconstitutional nature of the internment. But the stigma of being labeled national enemies simply because of their race lingered among many second-generation Japanese Americans.</p><p>Although life may have improved for some Filipinos following their service during WWII, many remained in a world of migrant labor. However, many Filipinos unionized following the war and became active in the <a href=\"/exhibitions/61/hispanic-americans-politics-and-community-1970s-present/#ufw\">United Farm Workers.</a> Philip Vera Cruz, for example, was a part of the UFW leadership along with Mexican Americans C\u00e9s\u00e1r Chavez and Dolores Huerta.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic2c.html", "hero": "03247be19e996bd57e12c613f38590e4", "lockup_derivative": "69fba7c37323481d0578e625094ce924", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/tf987010qj", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 55, "fields": {"title": "Asian Americans: New Communities, 1960s-Present", "slug": "asian-americans-new-communities", "short_title": "New Communities, 1960s-Present", "blockquote": "The 1965 Immigration Act ended various exclusionary immigration policies and facilitated massive new waves of Asian migration to California.", "byline": "\"Asian Americans: New Communities, 1960s-Present\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005 as part of the <a href=\"/cal-cultures\">California Cultures</a> project.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>The 1965 Immigration Act ended various exclusionary immigration policies. It also set up a system of preference that favored skilled workers and the families of American citizens. This landmark piece of legislation facilitated massive new waves of Asian migration. New communities arose, such as Los Angeles\u2019 Koreatown, and the Sikh community in Yuba City, whose temple is pictured here. As Asian migrants with more capital arrived, \u201csuburban Chinatowns\u201d such as Monterey Park grew.</p><h3>The End of the Vietnam War</h3><p>The end of the Vietnam War in 1973 brought waves of refugees from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Over 1.2 million people from Southeast Asia migrated to the United States, most arriving between 1975 and the late 1990s.</p><p>At first, most newcomers were those on the losing side, fleeing from the Communist regime; later refugees fled continuing political, religious, ethnic persecution. In the late 1970s, the United States accepted refugees known as \u201cboat people,\u201d mostly ethnic Chinese and Vietnamese desperately trying to flee Vietnam on the South China Sea.</p><p>An SOS collage speaks to the harsh conditions in Vietnamese refugee camps, as do the paintings The Strength of Youth and Dai Giang Nguyen\u2019s Life in the Camps. The rights of the boat people were still an issue in the 1990s, as demonstrated by the 1992 Walk for Boat Peoples\u2019 Rights.</p><p>The US government dispersed the refugees throughout the United States in small groups, hoping to mediate any hostility toward them from Americans who were worried about losing jobs to the newcomers, who were also a reminder of the contentious war years. The first major settlement was in Orange County, just north of Camp Pendleton, the port of entry for many refugees. Southeast Asians from around the country slowly migrated to Westminster and surrounding areas, which soon became known as Little Saigon.</p><h3>Assimilation and Tradition</h3><p>Over the ensuing decades, people from many cultures of Southeast Asia came to live in California, and began to assimilate into American culture. A Cambodian family posed for an anti-smoking poster; and a Lao farmer holds tomatoes in a field in Livermore.</p><p>They also kept their traditions alive. Many Southeast Asian groups are represented in these photographs:  A casual Hmong family party is held in a living room; and a more traditional Hmong new year\u2019s celebration is held elsewhere. Photographs also picture Liu Mien Yao people in traditional dress, including a baby wearing a Yao cap; three Lao girls in Lao dresses; and a family at Baci ceremony, a Lao tradition held to honor a variety of life events. Two young men participate in a Mien ceremony in Richmond, on the anniversary of a death; and Cambodian girls dance at a new year\u2019s festival in San Francisco. A monk is pictured in a Lao Buddhist temple in Oakland; and a Mien altar hangs on a wall in Sacramento; and picketers protest political unrest in Laos.</p><p>The Korean American community was also struggling with issues of assimilation and ethnic identity in the 1970s. In 1977, investigative reporter K. W. Lee wrote a series of articles about the wrongful conviction of Chol Soo Lee, a young Korean immigrant, for murder. These articles sparked the first successful pan-Asian political movement in the United States and ultimately led to Chol Soo Lee\u2019s release and full acquittal. In 1979, K. W. Lee founded the first English-language Korean American newspaper, <i>Koreatown,</i> which lasted until 1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1992, Asian Americans \u2014 Korean Americans in particular \u2014 came into the national spotlight during the Los Angeles uprisings. Following the acquittal of four officers who savagely beat black motorist Rodney King, Los Angeles\u2019 Koreatown, Pico Union, and South Central went up in flames as rioters looted stores. The news media tended to focus on the conflict between Korean shopkeepers and their black patrons, neglecting to highlight the legacies of economic deprivation and police brutality against blacks in the inner city.</p><h3>Asian Californians Today</h3><p>Today, California is home to 40 percent of all Asian Americans. The 2000 census showed that the majority of Cambodian (84, 559), Laotian (65,058), Hmong (71,741), and Vietnamese (484,023) refugees to the United States settled in California. Politicians such as Tony Lam and Tan Nguyen make sure Southeast Asian American voices are being heard. Quietly Torn, a literary journal by young Lu Mien women living in Richmond California in 1999, demonstrates that these recent refugees are engaged with American culture.</p><p>Although Southeast Asians have been in California for a relatively short time, they have become well established. Entrepreneurs own businesses, such as the market and bakery pictured here, and many have entered the middle class.</p><p>Asian American groups whose history in the United States goes back many more years are also thriving.

They portray business owners and laborers, families, and cultural celebrations. The images in this topic reflect more than a century of Asian life in California.</p>\r\n<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n<p>Asians began migrating to California during the <a href=\"/exhibitions/t3/gold-rush-era-1848-1865/\">Gold Rush</a> era. But a number of factors \u2014 including the 1882 <a href=\"/exhibitions/17/chinese-exclusion-act/\">Chinese Exclusion</a> act, the <a href=\"/exhibitions/t11/jarda/\">internment</a> of Japanese Americans during World War II, and the \"alien ineligible for citizenship\" status imposed on Asian immigrants into the 1950s and 1960s \u2014 limited their numbers. Nonetheless, as these images make clear, Asian Californians have been part of everyday life in California since the mid-19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like other immigrant cultures, Asians in California have struggled with issues of ethnic identity and assimilation. In the 19th century, some immigrants still wore traditional dress (like some of the men in Hanford\u2019s Sun Chung Kee Store, the bamboo flute player posing on the street in Yuba County, and the men and boys in the family on the street in San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown). As these images show, they own businesses, work for other people, attend school, and commemorate family events and important life passages.</p><p>As Asian immigrants have assimilated into the larger American culture, their photographs \u2014 such as the Murakami and Hirahara family portraits, the man standing in front of his car in the 1940s, and the Chan Brothers truck stuck in a flood in 1955 \u2014 reflect this \u201cAmericanization.\u201d</p><p>In the process, however, Asian Californians have also managed to keep a rich variety of cultural traditions alive, in public and private celebrations. For example, some later images document weddings and birthdays and holiday celebrations. These images also make clear the continuation of traditional religious celebrations (such as the Thai monks celebrating at the Wat Thai temple in North Hollywood, and the people eating at the Lao Baci ceremony), and the persistence of traditional community celebrations (evidenced by the many photos of dragon parades over the course of more than 100 years). Asian participation in contemporary arts is seen in the image of the Asian American Theatre Company\u2019s performance of David Henry Hwang\u2019s \u201cF.O.B.\"</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic2E.html", "hero": "bf8a0d14e17987142b3fcaa46dc34736", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt0c60175v", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 57, "fields": {"title": "Hispanic Americans: Migrant Workers and Braceros, 1930s-1964", "slug": "hispanic-americans-migrant-workers", "short_title": "Migrant Workers and Braceros, 1930s-1964", "blockquote": "During the 22 years of the Bracero Program, more than 4 million Mexican workers left their families behind and came to work in the fields of California.", "byline": "\"Hispanic Americans: Migrant Workers and Bracerso, 1930s-1964\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005 as part of the <a href=\"/cal-cultures\">California Cultures</a> project.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>During the 20th century, Hispanic Americans \u2014 the majority of whom were Mexican Americans \u2014 comprised the largest minority group in California. One-half million Mexicans migrated to the United States during the 1920s, with more than 30 percent settling in California.</p><h3>Migrant Workers</h3><p>The photographs in this section (many taken by Dorothea Lange) show Mexican migrant workers in California agriculture. Families (like the one whose car has broken down on the road) faced rough living conditions in the fields. The photograph of field shacks constructed of tin cans is a good example.</p><p>During the Great Depression of the 1930s, racial anxieties ran high. Mexicans in California and other states were seen as competition for already scarce jobs. Various civic organizations and chambers of commerce successfully pressed local, county, and state governments to round up Mexican Americans indiscriminately (citizens and non-citizens alike) and \"repatriate\" them to Mexico.</p><h3>The Bracero Program</h3><p>This situation shifted in the early 1940s. World War II brought a labor shortage as American workers joined the armed forces. In 1942, Congress enacted the Emergency Labor Program \u2014 called the <a href=\"/exhibitions/36/the-bracero-program/\">Bracero Program</a> (<i>brazos</i> is the Spanish word for arms) \u2014 to allow temporary Mexican migrants into the United States to work in American industry. In one photograph, a Mexican worker gives the V for Victory sign on the train bringing him to work in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 22 years of the Bracero Program, more than 4 million Mexican workers left their families behind and came to work in the fields of California. This migration had an enormous and lasting impact on the state's economy and demographics.</p><h3>Other Types of Work</h3><p>Not all Mexican migrants worked in the fields. As these photographs show, they found work in canneries and fruit packing, among other industries. Some were entrepreneurs, like the Veyna family of Anaheim, who opened a fruit stand (shown here), a restaurant, and a grocery store. Frank Gonzales, also shown here, was a barber.</p><h3>Illegal Immigration</h3><p>As it is today, illegal immigration was also an issue in the mid-20th century. A photograph taken in the 1940s shows a picketer in downtown Los Angeles, protests illegal raids by the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization.</p><p>A 1954 photograph shows a Bracero entering the country legally from Mexicali. Another 1954 photograph documents Mexican laborers returning home after they have completed their US work contracts. But the original caption asks: \u201cWill they go back home, in Mexico, or turn right around and join the thousands trying to get into the United States for harvest jobs?\u201d</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic3b.html", "hero": "d575b4ef1a43ea1e2e03a926d4391948", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/hb9g5009g4", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 58, "fields": {"title": "Hispanic Americans: Racial Tensions During World War II", "slug": "hispanic-americans-world-war-ii", "short_title": "Racial Tensions During World War II", "blockquote": "Two incidents in Los Angeles during World War II \u2014 which the press called the \"Sleepy Lagoon Trial\" and the \"Zoot Suit Riots\" \u2014 revealed the city's rampant anti-Mexican prejudice.", "byline": "\"Hispanic Americans: Racial Tensions During World War II\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005 as part of the <a href=\"/cal-cultures\">California Cultures</a> project.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>Two incidents in Los Angeles during World War II \u2014 which the press called the \"Sleepy Lagoon Trial\" and the \"Zoot Suit Riots\" \u2014 revealed the city's rampant anti-Mexican prejudice.</p><h3>Sleepy Lagoon</h3><p>The first occurred in January 1943, when 17 Mexican American youths were convicted of murdering a boy whose body had been found in a reservoir known as Sleepy Lagoon. Alice McGrath (who led appeal for defendants in Sleepy Lagoon case) and the Sleepy Lagoon defendants are shown in Chino in 1944.</p><p>The racist bias of the judge and prosecution was so blatant that the Sleepy Lagoon case attracted the sympathy of people around the country. Shown here is a six-page letter written to Governor Earl Warren, pleading for his intervention. Eventually, the case was overturned by an appellate court, and the acquittal was cause for celebration in the community (as shown in this courtroom scene).</p><h3>Zoot Suit Riots</h3><p>The second incident erupted in June 1943, when long-simmering tensions between white servicemen and Mexican American \u201czoot suiters\u201d turned into a week-long race riot. \"Zoot suits\" \u2014 high-waisted trousers with wide pegged legs, worn with long coats \u2014 were popular with Mexicans Americans, African Americans, and Filipino Americans during the early 1940s.

A photograph from around the same time (perhaps an ad for a car dealer) shows two women sitting on a car and being serenaded by a Mexican singer with a guitar. By the 1940s, the Mexican holiday Cinco de Mayo was being celebrated in Mexican American communities, as shown in the photograph of one such celebration in Los Angeles.</p><p>In a photograph from 1948, actress Anita Aros (center) poses with other costumed actors as they prepare for a fiesta on Olvera Street, a tourist-oriented street in downtown Los Angeles that was also the site for the photograph of the \"blessing of the animals.\" Olvera Street romanticized Mexican American life, but was also the site of historic buildings, such as the Avila Adobe.</p><p>\"Traditional\" outfits like those worn by Mexican cowboys from the Fiesta des Rosas in Santa Clara, and the souvenirs sold on Olvera Street, eventually became clich\u00e9. But Mexican American life continued to evolve.  In many ways, their lives were a reflection of American life. Oxnard's Dolores Tejeda won the title \"La Reina del Churubusco IX,\" Queen of Beauty of the Southland's Latin-American colony, in 1948. The same year, carrying on strong religious traditions in the Mexican American community, a little girl named Rose Veyna celebrated her first communion, in Anaheim. On a more somber note, a group of young women are identified in a 1942 photograph as a \"Mexican American female gang.\"</p><p>Although many migrant workers came to California during World War II, some Mexican Americans \u2014 like George Valdez (shown with his wife) \u2014 joined the armed services. And In 1946, Ed Roybal, shown here, was sworn in as the first Mexican American LA city councilman, representing the multiethnic (Mexican, African American, Jewish, and Japanese American) neighborhood of Boyle Heights.</p><p>Dolores del Rio, a famous Mexican actress, moved to Hollywood during the silent film era. Actor Leo Carillo, who became famous playing the stereotypical Pancho, sidekick to Duncan Reynaldo's Cisco Kid, was descended from an old Californio family. He later became a respected preservationist and conservationist, and Leo Carillo State Park near Malibu was named for him.

This cluster of quiet almost rural Mexican American communities was notable for the unity of the residents. Soon, however, the peaceful neighborhood would be gone. New housing laws, racial tensions, fears of communism, and economic and political realities all played a part the forcible removal of residents from their homes and properties in Chavez Ravine in 1951.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two years earlier, Congress had passed the National Housing Act of 1949 to improve the lives and standard of living for a broad range of Americans. The city of Los Angeles approved 11 housing projects, including one on the site of Chavez Ravine.

The remaining residents were forcibly removed from their homes and properties in a controversial eminent domain decision. As one photograph shows, even in 1959 the Arechiga family (joined by Mexican American city councilman Edward Roybal) was still camping out near the site of their former home.

The reality of their severe economic circumstances flew in the face of the popular celebration of California's Spanish past that flourished in the early 20th century. Even as Californians romanticized their state's 19th-century Mexican heritage, most turned a blind eye to the problems faced by Mexican Californians in the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"ufw\"></a>\r\n<h3>United Farm Workers (UFW)</h3>\r\n<p>In 1966, community organizers C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez and Dolores Huerta helped found the United Farm Workers (UFW), a labor union aimed at organizing migrant farm workers \u2014 mostly Mexican, but many Filipinos \u2014 who had endured decades of perilous working conditions, low pay, and no job security. (The painting <i>Campesino</i>, by Daniel Desiga, powerfully illustrates a farmworker thinning plants with <i>el cortito</i>, a short hoe. This backbreaking work was later outlawed by the UFW.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UFW flag was designed by Ricardo Favela and printed by Louie \"The Foot\" Gonzalez. It features a Mayan-inspired American eagle and the slogan <i>Huelga</i>, Spanish for strike. The UFW's most famous action was the Delano Grape Strike \u2014 a boycott of grape growers in the Delano area that lasted five years, and was later extended to include lettuce, Gallo wine (as shown in the photograph of a march against the winemaker), and the Safeway grocery chain (UFW complaints are outlined in a poster by Victor Ochoa). Eventually, the grassroots organization of impoverished farmworker families received support from the United Auto Workers, AFL-CIO, Attorney US Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and California Governor Jerry Brown. By 1975, a Louis Harris poll found that 17 million Americans were boycotting grapes. The UFW went on to enjoy other successes, and is still rerpresenting farmworkers today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez died in 1993. In 1994, President Bill Clinton posthumously awarded him the Medal of Freedom, American's highest civilian honor. Dolores Huerta, still politically active, was a driving force in the Chicano Civil Rights movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the UFW made huge gains, migrant farmworkers still worked under harsh conditions. The series of photographs taken in the 1980s shows workers gathering at a hiring hall, melon pickers being transported through fields in a truck bed, and a lettuce harvester in the hot sun. As illustrated by the photograph of the family harvesting walnuts in Gilroy, children accompanying their parents in the fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>La Raza</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The labor activism of Ch\u00e1vez and Huerta comprised one arm of the La Raza movement (<i>la raza</i> is Spanish for the race, or the people). It endeavored to expose and overturn the discrimination in employment, housing, and education that Hispanic Americans faced in California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The La Raza movement included muralists, poets, entrepreneurs, politicians, and labor organizers within its ranks, and descendants of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and other parts of Latin America in addition to Mexico. One poster that came out of this movement proclaims \"Independence for Puerto Rico.\" The poster of Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara has the words <i>\"Hasta la victoria siempre\"</i> (\"Keep fighting until victory\"), a phrase used by Guevara in the last letter he wrote to Fidel Castro, and a goal of La Raza. Guevara became a cultural icon and symbol for non-Cuban Hispanic Americans (his face is also seen on the picket sign carried in the Chicano Moratorium march, below).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Chicano Movement</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Chicano activists of the 1960s were concerned with reclaiming their pre-Columbian, Native American, and Mexican cultural identities. The Chicano Civil Rights Movement led to an increased understanding of Chicano identity in a historical, binational, and bicultural context. The Chicano Moratorium staged a walkout of high school students in 1968, and a demonstration in East Los Angeles in 1970 that drew 30,000 marchers. One photograph shows protestors holding signs that read, \u201cOur fight is in the barrio, not Vietnam.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chicano art movement began in the 1960s in support of the UFW labor struggle, and for Luis Valdez's Teatro Campesino (Farmworkers' Theater). Rudy Cuellar's poster is a lively example (the letters RCAF on the shirt pocket stand for \"Royal Chicano Air Force\"). Many of the other prints in this topic were produced by Self Help Graphics, an East Los Angeles gallery and community art center dedicated to exploring the culture and community of the Chicano movement in California. Later Chicano artworks (such as Ester Hernandez's biting 1982 <i>Sun Mad Raisins</i>) were often directly inspired by the political and cultural developments among \"working class\" (low-wage earning) Mexican Americans in California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wall murals, like the <i>Sherman Youth</i> mural in San Diego, became a popular artform. The muralists often used volunteers from the community, such the Woodrow Wilson Junior High School students shown in the photograph. The mural tradition has remained strong, as evidenced by <i>La Revolucion Continua</i> (1996), and by <i>Raza Unida</i> (200-2002), painted on a concrete freeway underpass in Chicano Park, San Diego.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hispanic Californians Today</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2000 census produced an informative snapshot of California today. The state is more multicultural than ever before, and 32 percent of the population is Hispanic American. These numbers have created both a rise in Hispanic American political power, and a growing awareness of issues that affect the Hispanic American community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, the historic struggle over illegal immigration and border control between the United States and Mexico has grown more contentious, and border crossings have grown more dangerous. The portion of the Border Crossing Memorial shown here asks, <i>\"\u00bfCuantos mas?\"</i> How many more? Between the two words is a series of wooden panels painted with red numbers, resembling a counter. The last panel has two numbers, as if in transition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ongoing controversies over illegal immigration and bilingual education have mobilized California's Hispanic population, even as they exposed internal class and cultural divisions. Despite a tradition of activism, Hispanic Californians had trouble winning public office throughout the 20th century. But the recent elections of Cruz Bustamante (Lieutenant Governor), Antonio Villaraigosa (Los Angeles mayor), Rocky Delgadillo (Los Angeles City Attorney), and Fabian Nu\u00f1ez (Assembly Speaker) suggest the arrival of a powerful 21st-century political presence</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic3f.html", "hero": "7a11e3697ae3e03c6d7433579df50e1e", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/hb8r29p57k", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 62, "fields": {"title": "Hispanic Americans: Everyday Life", "slug": "hispanic-americans-everyday-life", "short_title": "Everyday Life", "blockquote": "A glimpse into the daily lives and changing lifestyles of California's Hispanic Americans, as the nation moved from World War II to the era of social reform.", "byline": "\"Hispanic Americans: Everyday Life\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2009 as part of the <a href=\"/cal-cultures\">California Cultures</a> project.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2009, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3>\r\n<p>The images in this topic provide a glimpse into the daily lives and changing lifestyles of California's Hispanic Americans during the 1940s, 50s, 60s,and 70s, as the nation moved from the <a href=\"/exhibitions/t7/world-war-ii-1939-1945/\">World War II years</a> to the era of <a href=\"/exhibitions/t12/social-reform-1950s-1970s/\">social reform</a>.

By 1823, Spaniards had founded 21 missions and numerous villages from San Diego to Sonoma.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Spanish Colonization and Missions (1769-1800s)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The mission system was Spain's centuries-old method of advancing and securing its colonial frontiers by Christianizing and Hispanicizing native peoples. Lacking sufficient settlers, Spain used natives to colonize new lands and provide a labor force to sustain its colonies. One photograph (from ca. 1910) shows an old adobe building in Santa Clara, one of several built in 1792-1800 as dwellings for the Indian families of Mission Santa Clara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their 60 years of operation, the 21 California missions had employed 142 priests and baptized 87,787 natives. Missions were at once churches, towns, schools, farms, factories, and prisons, often operated in conjunction with a nearby military presidio and agricultural pueblo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the vast lands controlled by the missions made them a target of Mexican republicans who, after gaining independence from Spain in 1821, began calling for the privatization of church property. Secularization began in 1834. Half of all mission lands were to be turned over to local native groups, but distribution was haphazard. Native Californians were often swindled out of the land or simply never told that they owned land; subsequently, many drifted away, strangers in their own ancestral homelands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Spaniards, however, the California frontier was a place where <i>castas</i> (people of mixed ancestry) could move up the racial hierarchy. Over time, many Spanish families in California erased their African and indigenous ancestry by declaring themselves <i>gente de raz\u00f3n</i>, people of reason \u2014 in explicit opposition to California's native peoples. Affluent Spanish families could even purchase certificates of their blood purity from Spain. Wealthy Spanish Californians also held themselves separate from the <i>gente corriente</i>, working-class Spaniards who did not own their own land. The map of The United States of Mexico, shown here, illustrates how far Mexico's claims reached into what would later become of US state of California.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Rise and Fall of the Californios (1800s)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The decline of the missions allowed for the rise of extensive ranching along the California coast and in the Sacramento Valley. To encourage agricultural development, the new Mexican government distributed more than 500 land grants to prominent families, using maps called <i>dise\u00f1os</i> (like the colorful hand-drawn Dise\u00f1o del Rancho San Miguelito in Monterey, the Dise\u00f1o del Rancho de los Palos Verde, and the map of Rancho Petaluma) that roughly marked each grant's boundaries. This informal system of documentation would open the door to legal challenges by Americans after the US-Mexican War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well-connected families (such as the Vallejos, Alvarados, and Peraltas in the north and the Carillos, de la Guerras, and Picos in the south) could secure grants for each family member, creating an elite class of <i>rancheros</i> who controlled hundreds of thousands of prime acres. Photographs of some of these powerful men include Jos\u00e9 Andres Sep\u00falveda, mayor of Los Angeles in 1837; Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo; a group picture of Pablo de la Guerra, Salvador Vallejo, and Andres Pico; and Pio Pico, the last Mexican Governor of California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These families mainly raised cattle for an emerging hide-and-tallow trade with American ships that sold the hides to Boston tanneries and the tallow to South American candle and soap factories. The Californios held themselves apart from non-land-owning Mexicans and natives, intermarrying with each other and with the American and European entrepreneurs who began settling in California during the 1830s.</p><p>The US-Mexican War, however, reversed the fortunes of elite Californios, who slowly lost their power, authority, and land. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war, had granted Californios full US citizenship and promised that their property would be \"inviolably respected.\" But the informality of Mexican land grants made legal claims difficult when miners, squatters, and homesteaders overran Californios' lands, as the transcript of the legal challenge <i>United States vs. Mariano G. Vallejo</i> makes clear. shown here. In the case, filed on May 31, 1852, Vallejo claimed ownership of 66,622.17 acres in Sonoma County, at Petaluma and near Sonoma. He finally won the case in 1874, 22 years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even when Californio families won legal title to their lands, many found themselves bankrupt from attorney's fees or taxes. The Peralta family lost all but 700 of their 49,000 acres in the East Bay (encompassing the present-day cities of San Leandro, Alameda, Oakland, Piedmont, Emeryville, Berkeley, and Albany) to lawyers, taxes, squatters, and speculators. Eight Californios participated in the California constitutional convention of 1849, but over time their political power declined along with their land base.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Romanticizing History</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, during this period, Los Angeles boosters played up a mythical \"Spanish fantasy past.\" It popularized pastoral imagery of pious missionaries, quaint natives, and genteel Californios, and in some ways it persists to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil painting <i>Santa Clara Mission in 1849</i>, and the watercolor <i>A California Magnate in His Home</i> (it is General Don Andres Pico) are good examples of this genre. Still, although certainly not entirely realistic, these scenes serve to give some idea of what life was like. The oil painting shows vaqueros on horseback, Indians in a wagon, and a priest at the gates of the mission itself. The watercolor shows the \"magnate\" (General Don Andres Pico) and probably his daughter in the corridor of a farm building (the ex-mission of San Fernando) with a musician, men and women, and animals. In the distance are an orchard and vaqueros lassoing cattle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These scenes portrayed a California that no longer existed (if, in fact, it ever did). The actual Mexican population continued to suffer from racism and was sequestered to a portion of Los Angeles known as Sonoratown (the area north of old Sunset Boulevard, east of Broadway, and west of North Main Street).</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/calcultures/ethnic_groups/subtopic3a.html", "hero": "406ae6aaab5f9e11789baccf4f4b7e26", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt1k40184f", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 64, "fields": {"title": "JARDA: People", "slug": "jarda-people", "short_title": "People", "blockquote": "The images in this exhibition show the faces of Japanese Americans before, during, and after incarceration.

Most of the photographs were taken by War Relocation Authority (WRA) photographers for publicity purposes and tend to show people who are smiling or stoic. The paintings by internee artists Estelle Ishigo and Henry Sugimoto suggest a more emotional and somber mood.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the war, Japanese Americans largely lived in rural areas and in ethnic enclaves such as Los Angeles' Little Tokyo. The photograph of the \"Nisei queen\" shows people looking relaxed and happy, going about their daily lives. Some Japanese Americans worked in agriculture or blue-collar jobs, such as the former longshoreman pictured here; others owned or worked in businesses; still others were teachers, or artists, or homemakers, or students. The picture of the Mitarais before evacuation shows this successful farm operator and his wife and children looking much like any other pre-war middle-class family.  </p><p>During evacuation, Japanese Americans in the West were forced by government decree to leave their homes, businesses, jobs, school, and friends. The WRA photographs taken during the evacuation process show people waiting to be transported to the internment camps. The parents, grandparents, and children went as family groups. Many of the adults shown here are older adults and young women. In fact, a number of Japanese American men \u2014 like T/4 Taniguchi, shown with his wife and child, and the young man shown here in uniform \u2014 joined the US Army. One regiment, the Japanese American <a href=\"/exhibitions/39/the-442nd-regimental-combat-team/\">442nd Regimental Combat Team,</a>  was the most highly decorated American unit in WWII.</p><p>Most of the official photographs show calm, smiling, and happy internees, going about their daily lives: a woman knits in a room with her father, two women show each other their babies, and a little boy smiles for the camera, as do a group of orphans. A grandfather teaches his grandson to walk, a man supervises a camp agriculture product, a woman smiles with her bicycle, and everyone gathers to say hello to Eleanor Roosevelt on her visit to Gila Relocation Center. A camp \"Labor Day Queen\" happily eats an ice cream cone, in an echo of the pre-internment photograph of Little Tokyo's festival queen. The message sent by these photographs seems to be \"Life goes on as usual.\" </p><p>Internee art, however, tells a somewhat different story. Henry Sugimoto's painting <i>Send Off Husband at Jerome Camp</i> shows a mother and child waving goodbye as their husband/father goes back to war. But unlike the photographs, which avoid images of forced confinement, this painting also shows a guard armed with a bayonet attached to a rifle, barring the family from leaving camp. A stop sign also blocks their way, and a guard tower is shown in the background. Estelle Ishigo's painting, in quiet brown tones, shows an interned mother and child looking out past barbed wire fences.</p><p>After the war, families were released from the internment camps to resume their lives. The irony and poignancy of this time is reflected in Ishigo's sketch of her husband with the words \"Are We Americans Again?\" During resettlement, photographers seem to have been able to show Japanese Americans expressing a wider range of emotions. The image of people gathering to say goodbye to former internees who are being released shows one woman in tears. Still, most photographs show happy young faces, such as the Hiyashi family, who have resumed farming. The WRA is helping the Ikeyuchis (called \"loyal Americans\" in the caption, presumably because they were interned without incident), to find homes and jobs.</p><p>Many of the post-war WRA photographs make a point of the fact that Japanese Americans are being reintegrated into daily life. One blind veteran is surrounded by beautiful young women; Mr. and Mrs. Nishimura are back at work in their greenhouse and, according to the caption, \"things are working out fine\"; disabled veteran Isamu Oka and his family, interned at Heart Mountain in Wyoming, are now living in Los Gatos, where Oka is shown sitting in an orchard; and chrysanthemum specialist Ryohitsu Shibuya is back raising flowers in Mountain View, smiling despite the fact that he and his family are living in a small apartment and a packing shed while they wait to reclaim their apartment. Yet after the war, prejudice and discrimination still existed against Japanese Americans. Captain Daniel Inouye, who lost an arm in combat in Europe and would later become a US senator, recalled being turned away from a barber shop, even when he was dressed in his uniform</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/jarda/browse/people.html", "hero": "d70c1e31fe59f4fdb8ef0eacfc2ecb40", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/ft6489n9v6", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 65, "fields": {"title": "JARDA: Places", "slug": "jarda-places", "short_title": "Places", "blockquote": "Images document the places that played a role in the evacuation, relocation, incarceration, and resettlement of Japanese Americans during World War II.", "byline": "\"JARDA: Places\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005 as part of the <a href=\"/exhibitions/t11/jarda/\">Japanese American Relocation Digital Archive</a> project.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>From March 1942 to 1946, the US War Relocation Authority (WRA) had jurisdiction over the Japanese and Japanese Americans evacuated from their homes in California, Oregon, and Washington. The WRA photographs document the places that played a role in evacuation, relocation, incarceration, and resettlement \u2014 as the government wished to present them. Few, for example, show the barbed wire fences and guards that kept internees imprisoned. Although photographer Dorothea Lange also worked for the WRA, her images manage to suggest a more somber personal experience. In contrast, the paintings by internees portray the camps as experienced by the people who lived there.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>On December 7, 1941, Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. The next day the United States declared war on Japan. A photograph taken at the time shows a Japanese-American-owned business with a sign hung by its owner, a UC graduate, proclaiming \"I am an American.\" By spring of 1942, \"all persons of Japanese ancestry\" living in California and other Western states were told to prepare to evacuate their homes by order of Executive Order 9066, signed into law by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  Two public posters, one in English and one in Japanese, explain the evacuation and assembly process.</p><p>Several photographs show Japanese American neighborhoods in San Francisco and Los Angeles during evacuation, when families were forced to leave their homes and businesses. In Florin, near Sacramento, children play in front of a Japanese-owned store two days before they will leave with their families for the assembly center.</p><p>Each person was only allowed to bring what he or she could carry, which meant leaving behind or selling homes, businesses, clothing, furniture, pets, and other possessions and personal items. Some families were able to store belongings elsewhere, as noted in the caption of the photograph of the Taisho Y.M. Hall. Many, however, lost everything. One photograph shows a Yugoslavian farmer who is taking over a berry farm formerly operated by residents of Japanese ancestry. Many families, outraged by the violation of their civil liberties, destroyed their property and possessions rather than selling them to unscrupulous buyers who would only offer a pittance.</p><p>Internees brought their luggage (shown here piled against a moving van, and waiting to be sorted at a relocation camp) to train and bus stations and waited to be transported to local assembly centers that were located at race tracks (as shown in Yoshiko Uchida's painting of Tanforan), stockyards and fairgrounds, and other large facilities. A WRA photograph taken in Los Angeles shows community members waving goodbye to a group of internees who are leaving on a bus. Henry Sugimoto's painting <i>Take Fresh Air,</i> showing internees in transit being guarded by a ring of armed soldiers, is in stark contrast to the almost happy scene the government photograph depicts. At the assembly centers, they were dispersed to relocation camps across the West. One woman is shown standing in front of a list of family assignments, waiting to leave.</p><p>The WRA administrated 10 fenced and guarded relocation camps in California, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Texas, and Arkansas. One photograph shows a long line of people waiting to be admitted to Heart Mountain camp in Wyoming, which would soon become home to a large draft resistance movement. Another shows newcomers moving into Manzanar, in California's Owens Valley. As several images make clear, the relocation centers were barracks-like camps in remote desert or mountain areas. Paintings by Sugimoto, Hisako Hibi, and Estelle Ishigo (a European American who chose to be interned with her Japanese American husband) depict the camps as bleak, despite sometimes striking surroundings. Hibi's <i>The 3rd Winter in Topaz</i> reflects the length of time internees endured these conditions.</p><p>In December 1944, the WRA began a six-month process of releasing internees and shutting down the camps. In August 1945, the war was over. One photograph shows evacuees, still behind barbed wire, waving goodbye to friends who had been released. Several photographs show families returning home to Sacramento. Many of those who had no homes to return to were housed in yet another government facility, like the trailer city shown in the photograph of a resettlement camp in Burbank. By 1946, all of the camps were closed and the internees had been released to rebuild their lives.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/jarda/browse/places.html", "hero": "3b961254d9d00179da5f01c0840effd1", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/ft738nb40x", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 66, "fields": {"title": "JARDA: Everyday Life", "slug": "jarda-everyday-life", "short_title": "Everyday Life", "blockquote": "With thousands of residents, the internment camps inevitably became communities where families carried on with the details of daily life: adults worked, children went to school.", "byline": "\"JARDA: Everyday Life\" was curated and written by the University of California in 2005 as part of the <a href=\"/exhibitions/t11/jarda/\">Japanese American Relocation Digital Archive</a> project.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2005, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>About the Images</h3><p>With thousands of residents, the internment camps inevitably became communities where families carried on with the details of daily life: adults worked, children went to school. This topic illustrates much of the daily life of internees, including camp administration, sleeping/eating/personal care, work, social life, study, events, relocation, and resettlement. The images show daily life as the government portrayed it in \"publicity\" photographs taken by government photographers, and through the art and camera lenses of the internees who lived it.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Because of the numbers involved \u2014 the Tanforan Assembly Center housed 8,000 people, for example \u2014 efficient administration was crucial. Several photographs show the government bureaucracy in action. A toddler is given a medical exam on entry; and Japanese American nurses are shown working in a clinic at Tanforan. Another photograph shows the housing office, where workers administered the day-to-day operation of the camps. A list of rules gives some idea of the restrictions placed on personal freedoms at the camps.</p><p>Two photographs show the interior spaces of barracks looking cramped and small. In one, cloth partitions are used to create private spaces, because entire families occupied one room. In the other, a man rests on a cot beneath his clothing, which hangs on a rope above his head. According to the caption, the government only supplied the cot and mattress. Three other WRA photographs show people living in exceptionally neat rooms, spacious by comparison. These are in stark contrast to Estelle Ishigo's brown-toned painting of a family around a table, <i>At Home at Heart Mountain.</i></p><p>Meals were served cafeteria style. Two photographs show internees lining up for meals in the mess hall. According to one caption, they had to carry their own utensils and wash their own dishes back in their barracks. (Although these images show family groups eating together, historians and social scientists note that overall, family members tended to eat separately, weakening family ties.) Another photograph shows that evacuees worked preparing food for one camp in Arkansas.</p><p>Internee Henry Sugimoto's painting <i>No Second Service</i> shows a family eating in the mess hall. Signs on the wall warn \"No second serving!\" and \"Milk for children and sick people only!\" In his diary, Sugimoto commented, \"They knew that the Japanese really liked rice, so rice was always part of the menu at least once a day. However, there were times when the rest of the meal didn't really go with rice. At times, there would be food that just wasn't appetizing at all, so you had to either try to eat at least one bite or just go without the meal.\"</p><p>With so many people, privacy was an issue. Bathing presented problems, as shown in Ishigo's painting <i>No privacy for women and children</i>, and her drawing <i>The men had no bath tub so the[y] made one</i>. Tak Sugiyama's photograph shows a man bathing in one of the home-made tubs, a sawed-off pickle barrel.</p><p>Adults worked in the camps. In addition to administrative jobs (such as nurses, office workers, and food service), internees also worked in the fields. Many of them, according to WRA captions, had also worked on farms before the war. The man shown feeding turkeys had owned and operated a turkey farm in Marysville for 26 years before internment. Another photograph shows the staff of the Pomona Center News, a camp newspaper (artist Estelle Ishigo is pictured second from right in the front row). Some adults, judged \"loyal\" by the US government, were released to work outside the camps due to wartime labor needs. A photograph taken at Granada Center shows residents registering at long tables.</p><p>Despite internment, daily life for children still consisted largely of school and play. Photographs show boys playing marbles, a girl on a swing, and children enjoying softball and basketball. A group of children walks through the muddy street to school during a rainstorm. High school in camp had many of the attributes of high school in peacetime. Images show a school band practice, a dance in the gym, and art classes. Other students just enjoy hanging out together on the campus. Several captions emphasize that internees served as teachers, and even earned teaching credentials in camp.</p><p>The small and large events of daily life also continued for adults. These photographs show women in a beauty salon, and a group of people forming a YMCA branch at camp. <!--One couple is shown getting married at Santa Anita Assembly Center, looking happy despite the circumstances.  In another image, nurses hold babies born at the Tule Lake center.--> Inevitably, people died during internment. During the three years of its existence, the camp in Amache, Colorado, recorded 412 births and 107 deaths.</p><p>Some camps experienced resistance from internees. The photograph of a large number of people attending the funeral of James Wakasa in Topaz, Utah, is one example. Wakasa was shot and killed by a military sentry who claimed he was trying to escape. Residents demanded an investigation and a funeral outdoors, on the spot where he was killed. When their demands were refused, they stopped work in protest. Even after the funeral was allowed, the work stoppage continued. Eventually, the sentry was court-martialed and found not guilty. To prevent more protests, the government censored this from being reported in the camp newspaper.</p><p>When the war ended, the bureaucracy continued as interned citizens were released and resettled. The government hoped to disperse Japanese Americans throughout the country to prevent the emergence of Japanese ethnic enclaves. Scenes of assembly were now reversed. \"Moving day at the Jerome Center\" shows belongings being removed from barracks and loaded onto trucks. Another photo shows crowds waving goodbye as former camp residents board a train leaving the camp at Heart Mountain, Wyoming, and heading to postwar life.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "calisphere1/jarda/browse/daily-life.html", "hero": "ea694b89bb29e5bd5cd304a1de79fabc", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/ft4w1005gn", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 67, "fields": {"title": "JARDA: Personal Experiences", "slug": "jarda-personal-experiences", "short_title": "Personal Experiences", "blockquote": "The items in this exhibition were created by men, women, and youth during their incarceration in relocation camps.

Artists expressed the internal experience of camp life in paintings and drawings. Writings \u2014 including memoirs, illustrated diaries, scrapbooks, and letters home \u2014 reflect the daily struggle of men, women, and children trying to live \"normal\" lives in remote, guarded camps behind barbed wire. These personal creations express experiences that are often more emotionally complex than the official government photographs. The images in this topic depict reality through the eyes of Japanese Americans, reflecting a mix of emotions, including anger, uncertainty, and hope.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>The first image shows Estelle (Peck) Ishigo, a European American artist born in Oakland, California, who chose to be interned in Wyoming\u2019s remote Lone Heart Mountain Relocation Center with her Japanese American husband rather than endure separation. Her vivid personal memoir, <i>Lone Heart Mountain,</i> and somber paintings, reflect the struggle of many families to stay together despite hardship.</p><p>Colorful paintings by Henry Sugimoto, interned in Arkansas' Camp Jerome, express the anger and sadness of evacuation and relocation. In <i>Junkshop Man Took Away Our Icebox,</i> an evacuated family is forced to sell their possessions. <i>Goodbye My Son</i> illustrates the sad departure from the camp of a young Japanese American who enlisted in the US Army \u2014 a common event. Ironically, even as the US government denied nisei men their civil liberties, they asked them to fight in the war, identifying \"loyal\" internees through a controversial questionnaire. One question, for example, asked draft-age men if they were willing to serve in the US armed forces on combat duty, wherever ordered. Another question asked everyone in camp if they would swear unqualified allegiance to the United States of America and forswear allegiance and obedience to Japan or any other foreign government or organization. Even release from the camps was bittersweet for Sugimoto. His painting <i>Freedom Day Came</i> is a self-portrait of the artist contemplating a caged bird.</p><p>Tension between so-called loyal and disloyal internees sometimes erupted into violence. Sugimoto's 1943 painting <i>Rev. Yamazaki Was Beaten in Camp Jerome</i> documents an attack on Reverend John Yamazaki, suspected by other internees of conspiring with the government because he translated government documents into Japanese for the non-English-speaking population. In the left-hand corner is a poem composed by Yamazaki in response to the beating.</p><p>In the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, Sugimoto (the son of a samurai) revisited his camp experience in a series of paintings called \"Re-envisioning History.\" His long career as a painter spanned California, Paris, Mexico, and two World War II internment camps in Arkansas. He died in 1990 in New York City\u2019s Harlem, where he had lived for more than 20 years.</p><p>Painter Hisako Hibi (shown in <i>Study for a Self Portrait</i>) taught art during her incarceration in Tanforan and Topaz, Utah, and often portrayed the effect of camp life on mothers and children, as in the painting <i>With Mother</i>. In <i>Laundry Room,</i> mothers bathe their children in laundry sinks because the few bathtubs were almost always occupied. In <i>A Letter,</i> a woman reads a letter that begins \"Dear Mother,\" possibly from a son who had joined the US Army or a child who had been relocated outside the camps.

Currently one of the largest and most well known LBGT events in the world, in these years the parade took on its identity as a potent symbol of LGBT politics and culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n<p>The San Francisco pride parade grew out of decades of work to mobilize for LGBT rights. In the 1950s, people throughout the country hid their LGBT identities for fear of being fired from jobs, disowned by their families, or arrested. While early \"homophile\" organizations advocated for gay and lesbian rights, they did so quietly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1960s, the advances of the black civil rights movement encouraged racial minorities, women, and LGBT people to create more visible, powerful movements for equality. On June 28, 1969, patrons of the Stonewall Inn--an LGBT bar in New York City--rioted for several days following a police raid. Homophile organizers in New York seized on this activity by planning nationally coordinated parades to commemorate the riot and advance a more visible LGBT rights movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Influenced by the women's movement maxim that \u201cthe personal is political,\u201d LGBT activists increasingly argued that \u201ccoming out of the closet\u201d by publicly declaring one\u2019s sexual or gender identity was an important political act. Pride parades, in which participants took to the streets as a politicized LGBT community, were visual representations of this new political consciousness. Many cities in California and across the nation organized their own parades. For example, <a href=\"/exhibitions/78/items/ark:/13030/kt1t1nc2d9/\">this photograph</a> depicts people marching in San Jose\u2019s first lesbian/gay pride parade in 1974.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But by the late 1970s, San Francisco\u2019s pride parade had become the country\u2019s largest and most significant. In 1977 and 1978, when the photographs in this topic were taken, the parade had about 250,000 participants, making it the largest annual procession in the city. San Francisco had long been known as a mecca for LGBT people from across the country. In June 1964, America\u2019s largest-circulation family magazine, Life, proclaimed it the nation\u2019s \u201cgay capital.\u201d LGBT organizers in the 1960s and early 1970s had made significant gains in improving police relations, forming a strong gay business district, and enacting LGBT rights ordinances there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The parade also grew in response to nationwide repeals of LGBT rights ordinances that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Most significantly, in 1977, pop singer and Florida citrus industry spokesperson Anita Bryant formed a coalition to successfully repeal a LGBT rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. As <a href=\"/exhibitions/78/items/ark:/13030/kt32903458/\">this photograph</a> shows, marchers in that year\u2019s parade expressed their outrage at the repeal by holding a photo of Bryant along with Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, and a burning cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Encouraged by Bryant\u2019s campaign, the next year, voters in St. Paul, Minnesota; Wichita, Kansas; and Eugene, Oregon also overturned gay rights ordinances. <a href=\"/exhibitions/78/items/ark:/13030/kt6n39s0tc/\">This photo</a> from the 1978 parade shows marchers holding signs with the names of these cities emblazoned over images of Jesus Christ, signifying their feelings of martyrdom and persecution. <a href=\"/exhibitions/78/items/ark:/13030/kt1k40341v/\">Another image</a> shows marchers holding signs that denounced the Briggs initiative. The day after the Dade County vote, John Briggs\u2014state senator from Orange County, California\u2014announced plans to introduce legislation to prohibit gays from teaching in public schools. Voters ultimately defeated the initiative in November 1978.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The images in this exhibition show that diverse groups came together to march in the parades. Among the groups photographed included San Jose Gays, Third World Gay Caucus, Straights for Gay Rights, the Peace and Freedom Party, and Lesbians Under 21. Creating a unified LGBT movement was not without its challenges. In 1977, women formed a separate contingent at the front of the parade in response to what they perceived to be the misogyny of parade organizers. Parade participants often debated the appropriateness of drag performance, sexual expression, and racial and gender politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pride parades were also created to show the organized LGBT voting bloc and advance LGBT rights. As the photos reflect, politicians postured for votes from the LGBT community in these parades. By this time, organizers had made significant inroads into the city\u2019s political establishment: in 1977, Mayor George Moscone penned the first letter of support for the parade from a San Francisco mayor, and in 1978, the parade won City funding for the first time. In 1977, Harvey Milk became the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California. <a href=\"/exhibitions/78/items/ark:/13030/kt3s2035r4/\">This photograph</a> shows him speaking to marchers in 1978, as the city\u2019s first openly gay supervisor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the LGBT community\u2019s growing political power promoted a backlash against it. Just a few months after the parade, on November 27, 1978, Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated by former Supervisor Dan White. The assassination would galvanize San Franciscans, and the pride parade would continue to grow. Today, it is estimated at over a million participants each year, and additional pride parades are organized around the world. The rainbow flag, which was originally created for the 1978 pride parade, now flies over Harvey Milk Plaza in San Francisco\u2019s Castro neighborhood, arguably the best known gay neighborhood in the world. The flag and neighborhood continue to be symbols of inclusion and advocacy for the rights of LGBT people everywhere.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "52a3cb96803b0b650808a59fbba0f53a", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt6z09s25g", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 79, "fields": {"title": "The Letters of John Muir", "slug": "letters-john-muir", "short_title": "The Letters of John Muir", "blockquote": "Environmentalist John Muir dedicated his life to revealing the complexity and beauty of the natural world.

They show how Muir dedicated his life to revealing the complexity and beauty of the natural world as a scientist, writer, and activist. These are just a few of the more than 6,000 letters in the collection\u2014all of which are fully searchable on this website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n<p>John Muir lived a remarkable life of science and wonder. Born in Scotland in 1838, Muir immigrated to the United States with his family in 1849 and eventually moved to northern California. There, Muir made important contributions to the science of glaciology, wrote striking and influential articles and books about the beauty of nature, and advocated for the preservation of wilderness.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Scientist</h4>\r\n<p>John Muir\u2019s scientific curiosity led him first to explore botany. He corresponded with influential botanists like Asa Gray, to whom Muir sent <a href=\"/exhibitions/79/items/ark:/13030/kt3t1nd9xh/\">detailed descriptions and drawings of plants</a> he found in California\u2019s Yosemite Valley, which he <a href=\"/exhibitions/79/items/ark:/13030/kt6f59r933/\">first visited in 1868</a>. Muir lived in Yosemite for most of the next five years and would visit the area throughout the rest of his life. There, Muir developed a passion for geology and glaciology, and <a href=\"/exhibitions/79/items/ark:/13030/kt7000355w/\">he discovered active glaciers</a>. Muir made further observations and conclusions about how massive ice flows had once rumbled through Yosemite, carving its canyons and valleys. Although some \u201cprofessional\u201d scientists denounced Muir\u2019s ideas, <a href=\"/exhibitions/79/items/ark:/13030/kt667nf0w3/\">his Yosemite theories</a>\u2014many of which ultimately proved correct\u2014steadily gained a following within and outside the scientific community when they began to appear in print in 1871.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Muir applied the same methods of observation to the glaciers of Alaska, where he traveled and conducted research throughout the 1880s and 1890s. <a href=\"/exhibitions/79/items/ark:/13030/kt387030x1/\">Writing to his family in California</a>, Muir explained the complexity of glacial history, but also drew attention to the glaciers\u2019 awe-inspiring power and beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Writer</h4>\r\n<p>A prolific writer of letters, articles, and books, Muir\u2019s literary style bore the imprint of Romanticism, an intellectual movement that emphasized the spiritual and psychological value of the nonhuman natural world. The influence of Romanticism shines through most clearly in Muir\u2019s extensive correspondence with his life-long friend Jeanne Carr. Writing to Carr about Yosemite in 1874, <a href=\"/exhibitions/79/items/ark:/13030/kt667nf0xm/\">Muir mused</a>, \u201cHow complete is the absorption of ones [sic] life into the spirits of mountain woods\u201d (page 21).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carr encouraged Muir to write for a broader public through newspapers and in magazines such as Overland Monthly, Harper\u2019s Monthly, Scribner\u2019s Monthly, and Century Magazine, which were powerful shapers of public opinion and policy.  Century\u2019s publisher, Robert Underwood Johnson, <a href=\"/exhibitions/79/items/ark:/13030/kt9v19r9rg/\">took an early interest in Muir\u2019s writing</a> and to Muir\u2019s attention to details in description, explanation, and even form.  Muir gained a devoted following of readers, and his publisher encouraged Muir to exploit his popularity to advocate for protection of the natural world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Activist</h4>\r\n<p>Through his explorations, Muir came to believe that nature\u2019s complexity and beauty deserved and needed protection. In some cases, <a href=\"/exhibitions/79/items/ark:/13030/kt0n39r48q/\">Muir argued that nature provided resources</a>, such as fish and timber, which must be saved for future generations. In arguing for the conservation of natural resources, Muir took a utilitarian \u201cconservationist\u201d approach shared by other scientists and policy makers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Among the most notable advocates for conservation was <a href=\"/exhibitions/79/items/ark:/13030/kt7b69r80q/\">Gifford Pinchot</a>, the first Chief of the United States Forest Service, with whom Muir corresponded with on a number of occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Muir also argued that some special places should be preserved intact for humans to wonder at nature\u2019s beauty and complexity. This \u201cpreservationist\u201d philosophy motivated Muir in <a href=\"/exhibitions/79/items/ark:/13030/kt3t1nf0r1/\">his contributions to successful efforts</a> to establish National Parks, including <a href=\"/exhibitions/79/items/ark:/13030/kt7h4nf32d/\">Yosemite</a> (formerly a state park) and Sequoia National Park. In 1892, Muir helped found and became the first president of the Sierra Club, a preservationist organization. He also formed alliances with powerful policy makers, including <a href=\"/exhibitions/79/items/ark:/13030/kt7s203673/\">President Theodore Roosevelt</a>, who brought 430 million acres of land under federal protection during his presidency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Preservationist values could sometimes run contrary to the utilitarian drive of conservationists. That tension erupted between 1901 and 1913 during the fight over the damming of Hetch Hetchy, a valley in Muir\u2019s beloved Yosemite National Park. Advocates in San Francisco maintained that the city needed the dam and its reservoir\u2019s water supply for safety and prosperity. Muir <a href=\"/exhibitions/79/items/ark:/13030/kt2f59r76f/\">countered with a barrage of scientific arguments</a> and reflections on the astonishing beauty of the valley. Muir lost that particular fight\u2014O\u2019Shaughnessy Dam inundated Hetch Hetchy Valley in 1923\u2014but his passionate defense of the nonhuman natural world\u2019s inherent value has inspired generations of environmentalists.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "870c7c38fc73b44625414037ba71e4c4", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt7000355w", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 80, "fields": {"title": "City Scenes in California History", "slug": "city-scenes-california-history", "short_title": "City Scenes in California History", "blockquote": "The images in this exhibition give us a view of what life in California was like at street level in the late 19th century and early to mid-20th century.", "byline": "\"City Scenes in California History\" was curated and written by Julia Brashares and Kara O'Keefe Fos, in collaboration with staff at the University of California, in 2011.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "Julia Brashares, Kara O'Keefe Fos, and University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2011, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>Exploring the Images</h3>\r\n<p>The images in this set give us a view of what life in California was like at street level in the late 19th century and early to mid-20th century. The growth of cities and arrival of new immigrants following the Gold Rush added to California\u2019s ethnic diversity. In less than 100 years, California\u2019s population exploded: from just under 100,000 people in the first 1850 census to over 5.5 million people by 1930.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Geography and Industry</h3>\r\n<p>Many of these city scenes reflect the environment. Others show the impact of major industries connected to the area\u2019s geography. The present-day ghost town of Bodie in Mono County was constructed high in the mountains, alongside <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/kt567nc42d/\">gold mining operations</a>, so most building and living supplies had to be transported to the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The early gold country town of Grass Valley had <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/kt2p3015d3/\">elevated covered sidewalks and balconies</a> to protect people from muddy, unpaved streets and the mess of horse-driven transportation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early images of Signal Hill in Long Beach feature the <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/6b55bf33a519585ca7fee576a4abdf9a/\">oil derricks</a> that were so closely linked to the area\u2019s development. And Westwood, in Lassen County, grew up around the <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/tf78700763/\">lumber industry</a>, where mills were a common sight. <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/kt8d5nc24q/\">Orange groves</a> frame several early agricultural boomtowns, lending the inspiration for place names like the city of Orange in Orange County.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Culture</h3>\r\n<p>The culture of cities is also reflected in their buildings. Farming cities like Fresno displayed their growth and agricultural wealth with <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/kt8w1021t0/\">multistoried buildings</a> in the central downtown areas. Sacramento, the state capitol, copied the nation\u2019s capitol, Washington, D.C., with a grid of streets radiating from the centrally located <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/kt787019hh/\">Capitol Building</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Influence also came from neighboring Mexico. As early as 1904, mounted patrols began guarding California\u2019s southern border. When the border patrol became official in 1924, towns soon developed along the U.S.-Mexico border. Calexico was established to serve as a border checkpoint, and housed a <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/kt1489p9q0/\">U.S. Customs Office</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some cities still maintained elements of Spanish and Californio society in their adobe buildings. This can be seen in the <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/tf5290088p/\">first federal court building in Monterey</a>, and the beautiful Spanish <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/kt287016t5/\">patio of the Mission Inn in Riverside</a>. San Diego kept some of the Spanish Colonial architectural style but demolished and rebuilt larger, more modern buildings like the <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/kt6h4nc5x3/\">Santa Fe Train Depot</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Social Gathering Places</h3>\r\n<p>Stores, saloons, drugstores, theaters, hotels, and churches became central meeting places for people in towns and cities. By the 1890s, residents of the San Bernardino area might have purchased food staples from <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/kt6h4nc7md/\">Casner and Burns Grocery Store</a>. Spots like <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/ft6b69n7r0/\">Pinks Saloon</a> along the north coast provided places for people to gather, relax, and enjoy food and drink. Early drugstores, like <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/kt9r29q5fs/\">Clements in El Centro</a>, also served as the local ice cream parlor, lunch counter, and film processor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/kt229024cm/\">Theaters, like this one in Marysville</a>, became sites for popular culture. People who lived far from cities could still enjoy live performances and vaudeville acts. Some were later converted to movie theaters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hotels, like the <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/kt4z09q9j1/\">Acheson Hotel in Berkeley</a>, were meeting places for travelers and residents alike. Churches also served as community hubs. Some, like <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/3191e33bb77563870292903b930ab436/\">St. Vincent Cathedral in Los Angeles</a>, provided a geographical and social landmark in a rapidly expanding city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Streets, too, developed around social needs, many times based on the local industry or environment. <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/kt1489p8r1/\">Portsmouth Square in San Francisco</a> organized neighborhood development around a central plaza. <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/61b5d73729f7552b160c429bf50c5361/\">Third Street in Santa Monica</a> was envisioned from the start as a comfortable shopping district. And the <a href=\"/exhibitions/80/items/ark:/13030/kt5z09q1tm/\">storefronts on Palm Drive</a> near Desert Hot Springs, with their palm-lined walkways, consciously incorporated elements of the desert lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the cities pictured here have changed dramatically over the last 100 years. With the growth of the suburbs after World War II, for example, tracts of agricultural land became housing developments or shopping malls. Yet some old buildings and streets remain, providing vital links to a city\u2019s history and origins.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "414543efae15da7f09ae93a2dc906fe7", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt1489p9q0", "hero_first": true, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 81, "fields": {"title": "Civic Buildings in California History", "slug": "civic-buildings-california-history", "short_title": "Civic Buildings in California History", "blockquote": "Civic architecture embodies the way a community wants others to see it.

They built <a href=\"/exhibitions/81/items/ark:/13030/ft496n99q4/\">impressive courthouses</a> in places as far north as Eureka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"/exhibitions/81/items/ark:/13030/kt3g50175f/\">Mono County courthouse</a> was constructed in 1880 in Bridgeport with the immense wealth generated from the gold finds in Bodie. It is still in use today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Courthouses were also vital sites of community membership. <a href=\"/exhibitions/81/items/ark:/13030/kt0t1nc3v6/\">This 1915 image</a> shows Japanese citizens of Hanford dedicating a fountain in front of the Kings County courthouse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>City halls, like <a href=\"/exhibitions/81/items/ark:/13030/kt8779r1sw/\">this one in Marysville</a>, housed many of the institutions necessary to run city government and were generally large, impressive structures. Like <a href=\"/exhibitions/81/items/ark:/13030/kt167nb615/\">Santa Ana\u2019s city hall, shown here</a> with an early group of tourists, they were important civic gathering places for city clubs and groups. <a href=\"/exhibitions/81/items/ark:/13030/kt4m3nc4p1/\">San Diego's City Hall</a> displayed its patriotism with American flags and bunting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most notable is the construction of the <a href=\"/exhibitions/81/items/ark:/13030/kt2t1nf2dh/\">State Capitol building in Sacramento</a>. Using classical architectural components and modeled after the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., the impressive dome is still a reminder of the importance of government to the state. The building took nearly 15 years to complete, as you can see from <a href=\"/exhibitions/81/items/ark:/13030/kt8489q25z/\">this image of an early phase of its construction</a>. It still houses California\u2019s state government and serves as the central battleground of the state\u2019s politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Looking to the Future</h3>\r\n<p>The early 20th century was an era of great change, new technologies, and increased professionalization. Larger and more vertical structures were built to house the growing number of institutions needed to successfully run California\u2019s growing cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/exhibitions/81/items/ark:/13030/tf467nb5p3/\">Oakland\u2019s new city hall</a> was completed in 1914, after the previous building was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake. At nearly 320 feet, it was the first high-rise government building in the United States. It was also the tallest building west of the Mississippi when it was completed. In the wake of disaster, much of the Bay Area rebuilt itself using modern architecture, staking California\u2019s claim as a center of 20th century innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"/exhibitions/81/items/ark:/13030/kt196nb7z8/\">1928 Los Angeles City Hall</a> is another example of modern architecture. With 32 floors, and at 454 feet high, it was huge for its time, and is still in use today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The longevity of these institutions can be attributed to their modern construction and design, and their importance to a community\u2019s image. Los Angeles City Hall is consciously symbolic; among other features, its concrete was composed of sand from all of California\u2019s 58 counties and water from 21 missions. The building is an iconic emblem of city government, and its image has been on city police badges since 1940. And as recently as 1964, it was still the city\u2019s tallest building.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "3f3dcdc3ca4e231c42d326c5812675e9", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/kt8489q25z", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 82, "fields": {"title": "Disasters in California History", "slug": "disasters-california-history", "short_title": "", "blockquote": "From the mid-19th to early 20th centuries, earthquakes, floods, fire, disease, and other catastrophes shaped and re-shaped California\u2019s natural environment and the new towns and cities growing up across the state.", "byline": "\"Disasters in California History\" was curated and written by Julia Brashares and Kara O'Keefe Fos, in collaboration with staff at the University of California, in 2011.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "Julia Brashares, Kara O'Keefe Fos, and University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2011, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>Exploring the Images</h3>\r\n<p>Before European and American development, Native Californian groups altered the landscape purposefully to preserve it, and avoided areas they knew to be dangerous. But by the mid-1800s, the Gold Rush brought a population boom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These newcomers naturally built new towns and cities around bays, harbors, rivers, mountains, and fertile valleys. But because they didn\u2019t know the landscape\u2019s history, some communities were built on top of potentially dangerous environmental factors, such as flood plains and unseen earthquake faults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the mid-19th to early 20th centuries, earthquakes, floods, fire, disease, and other catastrophes shaped and re-shaped California\u2019s natural environment and the new towns and cities growing up across the state. These images document both natural and human-caused disasters across California during the era, especially the destruction to property and peoples\u2019 lives following fires, floods, and earthquakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Flood and Drought</h3>\r\n<p>Fresh water \u2014 in groundwater, rivers, and lakes \u2014 is one of California\u2019s most prized natural resources. But controlling and managing water for drinking and irrigation has not been easy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Images of <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/hb4m3nb05j/\">Oroville</a> and <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/tf9d5nb5bs/\">Alturas</a> in the Shasta Cascade region show the devastating effects of heavy rain and extensive flooding in the town areas. <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/kt2489q6sb/\">Flood images from Marysville</a>, in the Gold Country, show the streets filled with flood water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cities like Anaheim in Southern California <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/kt8199q44r/\">experienced major flooding</a> and immense population growth. A building boom resulted in the cementing over of natural watersheds, which increased the potential for flooding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Large-scale irrigation projects intended to help farmers and prevent cycles of drought and severe flooding continue to affect large portions of California. <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/kt0t1nc3tp/\">Canals built along the Kern River</a> near Bakersfield were crucial to harnessing California\u2019s agricultural potential. <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/kt138nc4jr/\">Enormous labor demands</a> were required to create and maintain the Central Valley\u2019s irrigation projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city of Los Angeles, now with a population of over 9 million people, was built in an arid desert. This meant diverting billions of gallons of water for drinking and agriculture from other sources around the state and building numerous dams and power plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Earthquakes</h3>\r\n<p>California\u2019s thousands of fault lines make cities throughout the state vulnerable. Because earthquakes reverberate far beyond the epicenter, widespread damage can result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1906 San Francisco earthquake was felt throughout the greater Bay Area. The <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/hb3j49p0kg/\">Old Russian Church at Fort Ross</a>, some 90 miles north of San Francisco, was damaged. <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/hb5m3nb49v/\">Parts of Santa Rosa</a>, some 55 miles northeast of the city, were in ruins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The devastation in San Francisco itself was significant. The city appears nearly flattened in <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/hb3779p0cd/\">this bird\u2019s-eye view</a>. The once impressive pillars of <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/hb6c6008nn/\">City Hall crumbled to the streets</a>, blocking roadways and creating safety hazards.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Fire</h3>\r\n<p>Fires, like the one that left the Central Valley\u2019s <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/kt0489q061/\">Kutner-Goldstein department store in ruins</a> in 1928, can change the landscape. The <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/hb8h4nb6dn/\">devastating fires</a> that followed the 1906 quake in San Francisco restructured the city. The fire killed 3,000 people, destroyed much of the city, and <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/hb987010bv/\">left 225,000 people homeless</a>. Although many stayed to rebuild, some \u2014 including Chinatown residents and many African Americans \u2014 relocated to Oakland, reshaping that city\u2019s demographics. Others fled to Los Angeles in search of food, clean water, and the supplies needed to rebuild their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Uncontrolled waste and vermin in dumps, in the streets, and in cramped living spaces contributed to disasters in densely populated towns and cities. In Los Angeles in 1924, pneumonic plague <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/tf1t1nb5bx/\">carried by rats</a> spread quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city established <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/tf1q2nb51m/\">disinfecting crews</a> to eradicate any potential infected rat and squirrel populations, and destroyed rundown buildings considered potentials for disease. <a href=\"/exhibitions/82/items/ark:/13030/tf8p3011vd/\">Suspect buildings</a> and people were quarantined for weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some quarantined neighborhoods were home to Mexican immigrants. This led to reframing dialogue about the disease in racial terms. The movement toward containing disease became about quarantining certain neighborhoods perceived as a \u201cpublic menace.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How disasters reshaped cities</h3>\r\n<p>Surprisingly, most disaster survivors \u2014 whether displaced by flood, fire, or earthquake \u2014 did not leave or move to safer ground. Instead, people worked to rebuild and reshape their cities in the same place. They used newer and better building materials and techniques, hoping to create sturdier structures that would withstand another natural disaster. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, In San Francisco, the earthquake brought down brick buildings and the fire burned the wooden ones. The city was rebuilt with more expensive but theoretically safer reinforced concrete, which allowed for taller, more modern, and more stable structures, changing the city\u2019s skyline. Although natural disasters continue to threaten California\u2019s cities and towns, its people continue to find new ways to reinvent and work with their existing environment.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "f4e3c1ea83faa05728541b3a2398ec59", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 83, "fields": {"title": "Everyday Life in California History", "slug": "everyday-life-california-history", "short_title": "", "blockquote": "These images give us a glimpse into everyday life in various regions of California during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.", "byline": "\"Everyday Life in California History\" was curated and written by Julia Brashares and Kara O'Keefe Fos, in collaboration with staff at the University of California, in 2011.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "Julia Brashares, Kara O'Keefe Fos, and University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2011, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>Exploring the Images</h3>\r\n<p>These images give us a glimpse into everyday life in various regions of California during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although many of the activities they show are familiar, the way in which people went about them is often quite different.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hard Work</h3>\r\n<p>Many people during this time period did hard physical labor every day.  In the central coast and inland fertile valley regions, migrant agricultural work was one of the few sources of income available. Whether <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt1s20160q/\">working in a Coachella Valley onion field</a> or <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt0n39p8r0/\">picking dates</a>, both in Indio, or <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt3d5nf10h/\">harvesting beets in Oxnard</a>, farm workers spent long hours in the fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Leisure time</h3>\r\n<p>At the same time, new technologies cut factory and office hours and created more leisure time for other people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some chose to spend time with friends at the theater, like <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt5k401924/\">this group of soldiers</a> in front of the now demolished Plaza Theater in downtown San Diego. Others, <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt9489q436/\">like this man</a>, played pool at Chilie\u2019s Place in Anaheim. The <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt938nc8r8/\">Santa Monica Pier</a> provided a Ferris wheel and other entertainments to visitors and residents alike. Families vacationing at Tent City, a holiday destination in Coronado, cooled off in the <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt7j49s103/\">swimming pool</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clubs and organizations were other popular ways to get to know people and share interests. In 1893, the women of <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt5j49q422/\">San Jose State Normal School tennis club</a> posed on the lawn with their racquets. In 1899, a <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/ft038n99r3/\">group of amateur astronomers</a> gathered in a field outside of Cloverdale to observe a solar eclipse. The <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt0n39p8t1/\">Eastern Sierra Ski Club</a> enjoyed a day on the McGee Creek slopes in Mono County in 1938.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>City Life</h3>\r\n<p>As early as the 1860s and 1870s, as today, <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt8489q1xv/\">Kearney Street in San Francisco</a> was a central artery through the city where people could shop, eat, and conduct business. But daily chores involved more than shopping at a mall or superstore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1890s, people in Berkeley did their banking and picked up packages at this Wells Fargo office, and bought groceries from <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt758027mw/\">this horse-drawn grocery store</a>. In the the gold country, <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt958027mh/\">a shoe repair business advertised on the street</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Public gatherings</h3>\r\n<p>In the early 20th century, parades gave community members the opportunity to gather, socialize, and remember events and public figures. This Armistice Day (what we now call Veteran\u2019s Day) <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt1d5nb0jb/\">parade in Oxnard</a>, on the central coast, commemorated the end of World War I with a marching band. Portersville, in the Central Valley, celebrated Armistice Day in 1922 with an <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt1p301885/\">automobile race through town</a>. The Chinese procession shown in this <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt6j49q20c/\">1903 Fourth of July parade</a> in San Diego highlighted the diversity of people who celebrated being American.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other parades marked visits from prominent national figures, including US presidents. Early in the new state\u2019s history, <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt1t1nc0nz/\">a visit to San Francisco from Ulysses S. Grant</a>, Civil War hero and later president, showed California\u2019s growing importance to national politics. San Diego enjoyed similar favor from <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt4x0nf1jc/\">President Benjamin Harrison's visit</a> to the famous Hotel del Coronado in 1891, and <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt3r29q019/\">President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s 1935 visit</a> to Balboa Stadium.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cultural celebrations</h3>\r\n<p>By the turn of the century, immigration was making California an increasingly diverse state. Parades gave many new Californians an opportunity to showcase their cultural traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown was the largest Chinese community in the state, but Chinese communities also thrived in the gold country and Shasta Cascade regions. People enjoyed the <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/hb1s2001js/\">Chinese parade in Oroville</a>, and the <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt4w10260r/\">Bok Kai dragon parade in Marysville</a>. The Bok Kai parade, ongoing today, may be the oldest continuously held parade in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some other cultural gatherings were held indoors. In 1930, <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt538nc6cc/\">a Japanese doll festival</a> was held at a Mexican Hall in San Bernardino. This Japanese cultural group utilized a meeting space shared by at least one other cultural group in inland southern California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old and new Californians celebrated birthdays and anniversaries. In 1933, friends and family members gathered at the Wakanoura Restaurant in Sacramento to honor <a href=\"/exhibitions/83/items/ark:/13030/kt896nd0xf/\">Asataro Nakano\u2019s sixtieth birthday</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Movies and popular culture of the time portrayed California as an idyllic place to live. Yet, as the images in this set show, everyday life was often very similar to that in other parts of the United States \u2014 people worked hard, ran errands, spent leisure time together, and celebrated national and cultural events. Despite many changes in the physical and cultural landscape, we continue to perform these activities in our daily lives.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "18e43fa5876ca8b2de1ce2f21a5f1583", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 84, "fields": {"title": "Transportation in California History", "slug": "transportation-california-history", "short_title": "", "blockquote": "Whether by horse and carriage, train, boat, automobile, or even airplane, transportation was vital to California\u2019s growth and success from the mid-19th to early 20th centuries.", "byline": "\"Transportation in California History\" was curated and written by Julia Brashares and Kara O'Keefe Fos, in collaboration with staff at the University of California, in 2011.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "Julia Brashares, Kara O'Keefe Fos, and University of California staff", "copyright_year": 2011, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>Exploring the Images</h3>\r\n<p>These images show some of the many types of transportation used in California by Californians \u2014 and by people coming to California from elsewhere \u2014 during the mid-19th to early 20th centuries. Whether by horse and carriage, train, boat, automobile, or even airplane, transportation was vital to California\u2019s growth and success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Railroad</h3>\r\n<p>In the mid-19th century, most newcomers came to California on foot, rode across the country in horse-or ox-drawn wagons, or arrived by ship from other parts of the world. But in 1869, the first transcontinental railroad linked the eastern United States with the west, transforming a hard four- to six-month wagon journey into a few days on a train.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The railroad also carried supplies and goods. <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/ft7n39n8pq/\">Logging trains like this one</a> in Humboldt County carried lumber to support the mining industry and to build new towns and cities across the state. Sacramento\u2019s <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/kt0h4nc27f/\">train depot and levee system</a> moved resources from remote areas to growing markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ships and Boats</h3>\r\n<p>Shipping was active on many of the state\u2019s natural bays and waterways. <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/ft6000045s/\">This photograph of a variety of ships</a> at Arcata\u2019s wharf in Humboldt County was taken sometime between the 1880s and 1920s, and shipping remains a vital trade link for California within the Pacific Rim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pleasure boats were common in California\u2019s coastal cities, as they are today. Boats and personal watercrafts, like <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/kt7w1021f0/\">the one shown here</a> in 1938, were a popular means of transporting people across Mono Lake. But the environmental damage this caused prompted such activities to be prohibited as a part of growing conservation efforts in the mid- to late 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Transportation Innovations</h3>\r\n<p>Change came quickly. By the turn of the 20th century, innovations in transportation technology dramatically increased the numbers of people and goods moving through California, and redefined how people lived, traveled, and communicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The invention of the safety bicycle in the 1880s gave people an alternative to walking and riding horses. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries bicycles had become a popular means of personal transportation, as shown by <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/ft958006cj/\">this large group of cyclists</a> gathered in Arcata plaza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California\u2019s burgeoning cities spurred the invention of new kinds of vehicles. The first streetcar systems, like <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/f4f9e06d-50b1-4c9c-a6e8-c4e0d62dc58e\">this one in Riverside</a>, used horses. But soon the newer and more efficient electric streetcars began to flourish in cities like San Francisco. <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/kt2c6016jp/\">Ferries</a> provided mass-transit and links to the trolleys for people commuting from the East Bay into the City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Los Angeles also had an early <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/tf8m3nb6pf/\">electric streetcar system</a>. But as the city\u2019s population boomed in the early 20th century, automobiles quickly replaced mass-transit as the way to get around the sprawling metropolitan area.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Open Road</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/kt8000275q/\">Automobiles</a> and <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/kt1v19q6bw/\">motorcycles</a> caught on fast \u2014 not only in Los Angles but also in the large cities in the San Francisco Bay Area. An <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/kt2c60172x/\">early car race</a> in Anaheim shows the fun and sport associated with automobiles in the early 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Motor vehicles also gave people new ways to explore California\u2019s diverse terrain. Families took <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/kt829035cd/\">road trips into the Mojave Desert</a> and along scenic ocean roads like <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/tf3w1007dw/\">17-mile drive in Monterey</a>. They also drove up <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/214128ba-8ce0-46a2-9f69-0d0440c5c022/\">mountains like Mount Rubidoux</a> in the Inland Empire, where a new road was constructed in 1907.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Motor-homes made it even easier to take family vacations. <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/kt7r29q40z/\">This homemade version</a> brought its maker to Yosemite National Park in 1921. The boom in road travel created a growing need for <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/kt996nc7z6/\">gas stations</a>, which also sold food and water to keep adventurous drivers on the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Airplanes</h3>\r\n<p>The first successful airplane flight by the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in late 1903 was an exciting glimpse of things to come. Although air travel was inaccessible to most of the public until after World War II, the possibilities of flight captivated Californians. Record-breaking flights and <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/kt2z09q6fd/\">air shows over towns like Marysville</a> attracted spectators from all over. By the 1930s, air travel was changing leisure time in new ways. In the rural town of Bishop, <a href=\"/exhibitions/84/items/ark:/13030/kt7k40219z/\">this small plane</a> promoted fishing in remote areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aerospace industry would soon find a home in the California. With increasing leisure time and evolving technology, airplanes would make the state \u2014 once considered the edge of civilization \u2014 a popular vacation destination for people around the world.</p>", "render_as": "H", "citations": "", "citations_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "scraped_from": "", "hero": "5eb4abcff178b688ac64efb08becb4f9", "lockup_derivative": "7034f0f0d3b379ce4adc476c9bf8b8cd", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "", "hero_first": false, "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.exhibit", "pk": 85, "fields": {"title": "Activism and Environmental Challenges: Southern California's Open Spaces", "slug": "activism-and-environmental-challenges", "short_title": "", "blockquote": "Southern California has distinctive landscapes that people have protected and preserved throughout its history.", "byline": "\"Activism and Environmental Challenges: Southern California's Open Spaces\" was curated and written by Brenna Davies, in collaboration with Christine Kim at Special Collections & Archives at the UC Irvine Libraries, in 2016.", "byline_render_as": "H", "curator": "Brenna Davies and Christine Kim", "copyright_year": 2016, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "overview": "<h3>Overview</h3>\r\n<p>Southern California is home to a variety of environmental regions, each with its own distinct weather patterns, wildlife, and vegetation.

Best known for his development of the theory of Transactional Analysis, Berne published dozens of scholarly articles in the field of psychoanalysis and was the author of eight major books, including the bestseller Games People Play. He was a Diplomate of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, a Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, a Corresponding Member of the Indian Psychiatric Society, and a member of the American Medical Association and the American Group Psychotherapy Association. He served as a consultant in psychiatry at Mt. Zion Hospital and at the McAuley Neuropsychiatric Institute (St. Mary\u2019s Hospital) in San Francisco, and was an Associate Psychiatrist and Lecturer in Psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBerne founded the International Transactional Analysis Association in 1964 to advance his teachings and to organize a community of fellow practitioners. The ITAA currently has approximately 1,000 members worldwide.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEric Lennard Bernstein was born May 10, 1910 in Montreal, Quebec, to parents David Hillel Bernstein, M.D., and Sara Gordon Bernstein. His father was a general practitioner and worked from an office in the family\u2019s home on Sainte Famille Street. Sara Bernstein was a professional writer and editor. Both parents graduated from McGill University, which Berne later attended. He had one sister, Grace, born in 1915. Dr. Bernstein died in 1920 of tuberculosis when Berne was only 9 years old; his mother never remarried, and worked as a teacher and newspaper reporter to support the family.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBerne enrolled at McGill University to study English, and worked at the Royal Montreal Golf Club to help pay his tuition. Known as \u201cLennie\u201d to his classmates, he earned scholarships in mathematics and psychology and wrote for the college literary magazine under fanciful nom de plumes such as Ramsbottom Horseley, Lennard Gandalac, Cynical St. Cyr, Peter Pinto, and Count Gandalac. He earned his B.A. in 1931 and continued at McGill to earn his M.D. and C.M. (Master of Surgery) degrees in 1935.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBerne came to the United States in 1935 for a one-year internship at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey, followed by a two-year residency program in psychiatry at the Psychiatric Clinic of Yale University School of Medicine.  After completing his residency in 1938 he traveled to Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey to study psychiatric illnesses and mental hospital facilities in different parts of the world. This research continued throughout his professional life, and he published studies including \u201cPsychiatry in Syria\u201d (1939), \u201cSome Oriental Mental Hospitals\u201d (1949), \u201cDifficulties of Comparative Psychiatry: The Fiji Islands\u201d (1959), \u201cThe Cultural Problem: Psychopathology in Tahiti\u201d (1960) and \u201cA Psychiatric Census of the South Pacific\u201d (1960).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1938-1939 Berne became an American citizen and shortened his name to Eric Berne. He began practicing psychiatry at the Wadsworth Sanitarium and at a private practice in Norwalk, Connecticut. He continued training at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute under Dr. Paul Federn, an Austrian psychoanalyst whose research in \u201cego psychology\u201d influenced Berne\u2019s development of Transactional Analysis. Berne married Ruth Harvey in 1942, with whom he had two children. The marriage ended in divorce in 1946.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1943 he enlisted in the U.S. Army Medical Corps as a 1st Lieutenant and was assigned to Baxter General Hospital in Spokane, WA and later to Fort Ord Regional Hospital near Monterey, CA. He advanced to the rank of Major before leaving the service in 1946. After World War II Berne settled in nearby Carmel-by-the-Sea, a small community of artists and free-thinkers. He began working on his first book, The Mind in Action, which was published by Simon and Schuster in 1947. Berne continued his formal training as a psychoanalyst at the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute, under the tutelage of prominent psychologist Erik Erikson.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1947 Berne met Dorothy de Mass Way, a recently divorced young woman with three children, at one of the intellectual salons he hosted at his home in Carmel. They married on Christmas Eve, 1948. Berne and Dorothy had two sons, Eric Jr. and Terence. Berne continued to write and publish articles, spending hours in his separate study. He accepted an appointment as Assistant Psychiatrist at Mt. Zion Hospital in San Francisco while simultaneously serving as a Consultant to the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army. He also worked as Adjunct and Attending Psychiatrist at the Veterans Administration and Mental Hygiene Clinic in San Francisco in addition to his private practices in San Francisco and Carmel.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy 1950 his approach to psychotherapy and analysis had diverged from more traditional practices, and he terminated his study at the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute. He began developing his own school of thought which eventually became Transactional Analysis. Berne viewed social interactions as basic exchanges, or \u201ctransactions\u201d between people, who acted from one of three ego-states (Parent, Adult, or Child) in order to get what they want. Berne termed these common transactions \u201cgames\u201d and analyzed them using frank and often humorous titles like \u201cWhy Does This Always Happen to Me\u201d (WAHM) and \u201cLet\u2019s You and Him Fight\u201d (LYAHF). By 1958 he had published three seminal articles outlining the theory of Transactional Analysis: \u201cIntuition V: The Ego Image\u201d (1957); \u201cEgo States in Psychotherapy\u201d (1957); and \u201cTransactional Analysis: A New and Effective Method of Group Therapy\u201d (1958).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBeginning in 1950-1951 Berne led evening seminars in Carmel to bring friends and followers together to discuss and test his new methods. In San Francisco he formalized this practice and organized the San Francisco Social Psychiatry Seminars (SFSPS), which incorporated in 1962 and began publishing the Transactional Analysis Bulletin with Berne as editor. Two years later the organization became the International Transactional Analysis Association (ITAA) to include practitioners from around the country and around the world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1964 Berne published Games People Play to share his theories and methods with psychiatrists and other mental health professionals. It achieved spectacular success as a popular self-help book, selling over 2 million copies and spending 111 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Berne\u2019s professional success took a toll on his personal life, and he divorced his second wife Dorothy in 1964. He continued writing and publishing articles and books, including Principles of Group Treatment (1966) and Sex in Human Loving (1970), based on a lecture he presented at the Jake Gimbel Sex Lecture Series at the Langley-Porter Psychiatric Clinic at the University of California, San Francisco. He married a third time in 1967, to Torre Peterson Rosenkranz, but divorced in 1970. Berne was completing the manuscript for his final book, What Do You Say After You Say Hello? when he was hospitalized with chest pains. Eric Berne died from a massive heart attack on July 15, 1970. He is buried in the El Carmelo Cemetery in Pacific Grove, California.\r\n</p>\r\n<h1>Sources:</h1>\r\n<p>\r\nBerne, Eric. A Montreal childhood.

Chronologies usually provide finite dates marking the beginning and end of any given war.

Over millennia, waves of migrants explored and settled the region, turning California into one of the most densely populated areas in all of North America. More than 300,000 people lived in California at the time of Spanish colonization in the late 18th century. These native peoples were not organized in a single society, as were the Aztecs to the south, but lived in hundreds of small, politically autonomous communities connected by trade and kinship networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hundreds of Diverse Cultures</h2>\r\n<p>The early Native Californian communities were astonishingly diverse in culture and way of life, ranging from the seafaring Chumash to the agricultural Yuma to the nomadic Modoc. Native California groups spoke at least 100 different mutually unintelligible languages, ate different foods, and practiced different religions. These communities had no alphabets and left no written records for historians to interpret, so what we know about Native Californians before the arrival of Europeans is based on four sources:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>archaeological evidence;</li>\r\n<li>early records of European explorers and colonists;</li>\r\n<li>oral histories given by tribal elders in the early 20th century; and</li>\r\n<li>oral traditions passed down to later generations of Native Californians.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This diversity and lack of written records make reconstructing their world a challenge. Nonetheless, we do have some information that helps us to understand pre-Columbian California.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Six Geographical Culture Areas</h2>\r\n<p>Early anthropologists divided California's native groups into six geographical \"culture areas.\" This system remains useful, although the boundaries should not be considered rigid. Scholars today emphasize how each area overlapped and contained plenty of internal variety:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The <b>Colorado River</b> area was home to tribes speaking Yuma, Mohave, and Halchidhoma. They practiced subsistence agriculture, cultivating maize, pumpkins, and beans.</li>\r\n<li>The <b>southern area</b> was home to Chumash, Serrano, Garbielino, Cahuilla, Lise\u00f1o, and other language speakers. It supported increasingly larger chiefdoms with complex, stratified social structures.</li>\r\n<li>In the <b>Great Basin area</b>, along the eastern edge of California, desert groups such as the Paiute, Washo, and Mono made use of rabbits, pine nuts, acorns, and wild plants.</li>\r\n<li>The enormous <b>central culture area</b> contained the Bay Area, and the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys. Here Ohlone, Miwok, Patwin, Pomo, Maidu, and other language groups hunted deer, pronghorn, elk, rabbits, fowl, and fish, and often lived in wooden houses covered with soil.</li>\r\n<li>In the <b>northwest area</b>, home to the Yoruk, Shasta, Hupa, and other groups, abundant coastal resources (including redwoods) encouraged the development of sophisticated woodworking, canoe-building, and house-building skills.</li>\r\n<li>Modoc, Achumawi, and Atsugewi speakers in the <b>northeast area</b> shared more with Columbia Plateau peoples of eastern Oregon and Washington than they did with other California groups. This underscores the incredible diversity of Native California.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Shaping the Environment</h2>\r\n<p>One activity shared by all native Californians was interaction with and manipulation of the environment. Using combinations of hunting, gathering, fishing, and agriculture, they skillfully harvested California's natural resources.</p>\r\n<p>Many groups dried, shelled, ground, washed, and cooked acorns into soup and bread, flavored with berries, seeds, and nuts. Some caught trout, salmon, and shellfish with harpoons and nets. Others hunted elk, deer, rabbits, and fowl with bows and obsidian-tipped arrows.</p>\r\n<p>Whether they lived in mountains, valleys, deserts, forests, or beaches, native peoples continually tended and cultivated the land through controlled burnings, weeding, pruning, tilling, irrigation, and selective replanting. Because native groups usually altered the landscape in a way that mimicked nature, Europeans mistakenly assumed natives lived in an untouched \"wilderness.\" They could not see how thoroughly California's environment had been transformed by thousands of years of human use.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Community Life</h2>\r\n<p>Most California native communities consisted of between 200 and 500 people under the authority of a male leader. Typically, social life was focused around a central village where the leader lived, surrounded by smaller settlements.</p>\r\n<p>Boundaries between each community's land \u2014 usually 8 to 10 square miles \u2014 were acknowledged, but groups tended to allow neighbors access for gathering and hunting purposes. Areas with greater natural resources, such as in the San Joaquin Valley and along the coast, usually supported more communities with smaller land bases.</p>\r\n<p>In general, more nomadic groups tended to have greater social equality. More sedentary groups \u2014 such as the maritime Yurok of the northwest \u2014 had hierarchical social classes with a wide gulf between rich and poor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2> Basketry</h2>\r\n<p>Elaborate basketry was an integral component of Native Californian culture and subsistence. Baskets were both beautiful and functional. They varied greatly by shape and size based on their function, be it for gathering food, sifting acorn meal, storing tobacco, gambling, cooking, and even transporting water. Native Californians could weave so tightly that their baskets held boiling water \u2014 heated by hot rocks \u2014 without leaking.</p>\r\n<p>Baskets varied from group to group in their weaving style and decorative design, often incorporating feathers and beads. Native basketry was so accomplished that pottery-making was rare, only prevalent among southeastern groups. Today, basketry remains important to Native Californian cultures, and California baskets are widely sought after as sophisticated art objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A Dynamic Network</h2>\r\n<p>With its tremendous cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity and constant in- and out-migration, Native California was a dynamic network of divided but interconnected communities forced to cooperate and interact. In this sense, it was a world not unlike the California of today.</p>", "render_as": "H", "byline": "\"Before 1768: Pre-Columbian California\" was written by Joshua Paddison and the University of California in 2005 as part of the [California Cultures](/cal-cultures) project.", "byline_render_as": "M", "curator": "University of California", "copyright_year": 2011, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "go_further": "<h4>Online</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://cimcc.org/\">California Indian Museum and Cultural Center</a></p> \r\n\r\n<p>Edward D.

After conquering and plundering the Aztec empire in present-day Mexico City in 1519, Spanish conquistadors were eagerly exploring northward, lured by rumors of fabulous golden cities. Spanish explorers found the tip of what is now Baja California in 1533 and named it \"California\" after a mythical island in a popular Spanish novel. Nine years later, a Spanish ship commanded by Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo sailed as far north as present-day Oregon, making several landings along the way. During the following two centuries, Spanish galleons became frequent visitors to California's waters, sailing through on their way from Manila to Acapulco.</p>\r\n<h2>Trade and New Diseases</h2>\r\n<p>Native Californians were accustomed to interacting with an array of outside groups, and they generally welcomed the Spanish as fascinating \u2014 if bizarre \u2014 trading partners. Spanish sea captains recorded how local native communities greeted arriving ships with gifts of food and other displays of friendship. Driven by curiosity and a desire for European manufactured goods, native Californians established regular trading relationships with the Spanish. Access to Spanish goods increased coastal groups' power and prestige, giving them greater leverage in dealings with inland groups.</p>\r\n<p>The Spanish germs and microbes that accompanied these goods, however, triggered terrible changes in the demographics of native California. Smallpox, influenza, dysentery, malaria, measles, and syphilis \u2014 all unknown to North American immune systems \u2014 inexorably spread from group to group. By 1848, diseases springing from centuries of interaction with the Spanish had reduced California's native population by more than two-thirds. This catastrophic decline disrupted families, communities, and trading networks, weakening native resistance to Spanish, Mexican, and American intrusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Spanish Missions and Colonization</h2>\r\n<p>Spain claimed California but considered it too far north to settle. California remained an uncolonized periphery of the Spanish empire until rumors of British and Russian interest in the region prompted a defensive expansion up the coast. In 1769, a \"sacred expedition\" (three ships and two overland parties) led by Captain Gaspar de Portol\u00e1 and Franciscan Father Jun\u00edpero Serra established outposts at San Diego and Monterey. By 1823, Spaniards had founded 21 missions and numerous villages from San Diego to Sonoma.</p>\r\n<p>The mission system \u2014 springing equally from political, economic, and religious motivations \u2014 was Spain's centuries-old method of advancing and securing its colonial frontiers by Christianizing and Hispanicizing native peoples. Lacking sufficient settlers, Spain used natives to colonize new lands and provide a labor force to sustain its colonies. California's missions were one leg of a far-flung mission system that extended to Baja California and the present-day states of Florida, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A New Racial Hierarchy</h2>\r\n<p>Spain's empire in the Americas maintained a complex racial classification system that arranged people hierarchically based on the \"purity\" of their blood. The California frontier \u2014 free of imperial bureaucracy and pure-blooded elites \u2014 was a place where castas (people of mixed ancestry) could move up the racial hierarchy. Much of the population in California that referred to themselves as \"Spaniards\" in the 18th and early 19th centuries were of mixed Spanish, African, and Native American ancestry.</p>\r\n<p>Over time, many people negated their African and indigenous ancestry by declaring themselves gente de raz\u00f3n (people of reason) in explicit opposition to California's native peoples. Affluent Spanish families could even purchase certificates of their blood purity from Spain. Wealthy Spanish Californians also held themselves separate from the gente corriente, working-class Spaniards who did not own their own land.</p>\r\n<p>Never as racially stratified as other parts of Spanish America, colonial California (1769-1820s) developed a racial hierarchy: land-owning \"Spaniards\" and missionaries at the top, working-class gente corriente in the middle, and Christianized native Californians at the bottom, with non-Christian natives a constant outside presence. These racial categories were based more on perception and the ability to influence official record keeping than on actual genetics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A Violent and Fragile New World</h2>\r\n<p>As time passed, the lives of Spanish settlers and native peoples became intertwined in a shifting series of uneasy relationships. Spaniards possessed manufactured goods and superior weapons, while natives had far greater numbers and intimate knowledge of the landscape. Motivated by curiosity and self-interest, many native Californians joined Spanish missions and villages only to discover they were not permitted to leave. Outbreaks of violence became a constant part of life in colonial California, but so did intercultural communication and accommodation. The Spanish suffered raids on their livestock and lived under a constant threat of uprising, while native groups fashioned new ways of life in the wake of disease, new technologies, and a foreign political structure. Spaniards and natives together created a new world in California that was dynamic and violent, unfamiliar and fragile.</p>", "render_as": "H", "byline": "\"1768-1820s: Exploration and Colonial California\" was written by Joshua Paddison and the University of California in 2005 as part of the [California Cultures](/cal-cultures) project.", "byline_render_as": "M", "curator": "University of California", "copyright_year": 2011, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "go_further": "<h4>Online</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Edward D.

Politically, the changeover from Spanish to Mexican control in 1821 brought new laws, new administrators, and a shift of power from missionaries to secular governors and powerful ranching families. Demographically, the emigration of Mexican settlers, Russian colonists, American fur trappers and homesteaders, and European entrepreneurs introduced new social complexities. Environmentally, the arrival of European weeds, crops, and animals \u2014 especially cattle and horses \u2014 transformed California's natural spaces. By the time the US-Mexican War broke out in 1846, much of California was unrecognizable to native groups that had witnessed the coming of the Spaniards less than 80 years before.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Decline of the Mission System</h2>\r\n<p>When the Franciscans erected their final California mission in 1823, they seemed at the height of their powers. In the 60 years of their operation, the 21 California missions had employed 142 priests and baptized 53,600 natives. Missions were at once churches, towns, schools, farms, factories, and prisons, often operated in conjunction with a nearby military presidio and agricultural pueblo.</p>\r\n<p>But the vast lands controlled by the missions made them a target of Mexican republicans who, after gaining independence from Spain in 1821, began calling for the privatization of church property. Secularization began in 1834, with half of all mission lands to be turned over to local native groups, but distribution was haphazard. Native Californians were often never told that they owned land, and many drifted away, strangers in their own ancestral homelands.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Rise of the Californios</h2>\r\n<p>The decline of the missions allowed for the rise of extensive ranching along the California coast and in the Sacramento Valley. To encourage agricultural development, the new Mexican government distributed more than 500 land grants to prominent families, using maps called dise\u00f1os that roughly marked each grant's boundaries. This informal system of documentation would open the door to legal challenges by Americans after the US-Mexican War. Well-connected families (such as the Vallejos, Alvarados, and Peraltas in the north and the Carillos, de la Guerras, and Picos in the south) could secure grants for each family member, creating an elite class of rancheros who controlled hundreds of thousands of prime acres.</p>\r\n<p>These families mainly raised cattle for an emerging hide-and-tallow trade with American ships that sold the hides to Boston tanneries and the tallow to South American candle and soap factories. These elite Californios \u2014 as they became known \u2014 held themselves apart from non-land-owning Mexicans and natives, intermarrying with each other and with the American and European entrepreneurs who began settling in California during the 1830s.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>New Ethnicities and Identities</h2>\r\n<p>Just as they had for the mission system, native Californians provided most of the labor for the emergent ranching economy. They worked as vaqueros herding cattle, processed tallow in huge iron pots, tended gardens, and harvested crops. Spanish-speaking natives intermarried with working-class Mexicans, blurring already complicated racial categories.</p>\r\n<p>Laborers were bound to their ranches in a state of perpetual peonage, with difficult working conditions and few alternatives. In response, some natives fled inland, joining mountain or desert groups and using their ranching knowledge to organize raids on livestock. Spanish became the common language for native groups throughout California struggling to survive in the face of massive social changes, environmental degradation, and rampant disease. Displacement and depopulation contributed to an intense process of what anthropologists call \"ethnogenesis,\" the creation of new ethnicities and identities. Native groups combined, split apart, and recombined in new ways in response to perilous times.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Europeans and Americans Arrive</h2>\r\n<p>In the 1830s and 1840s, increasing numbers of Europeans and Americans arrived in California. Some, such as Scottish sailor John Gilroy, left their ships, became Mexican citizens, converted to Catholicism, and married into Californio families. Others, like John Marsh from Massachusetts and John Sutter from Switzerland, made the treacherous overland journey to set up profitable ranches in the Central Valley.</p>\r\n<p>Most American visitors to Mexican California portrayed it as a land of abundant resources underutilized by the \"idle\" Californios. \"In the hands of an enterprising people, what a country this might be!\" exclaimed Richard Henry Dana, Jr., in his popular travel memoir Two Years Before the Mast. Dana's account fed into preexisting conceptions that condemned Latin Americans as lazy, corrupt, and immoral due to their racial \"impurity\" and Catholicism.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Manifest Destiny</h2>\r\n<p>These racial and religious biases fit snugly within a broader ideology of Manifest Destiny, the mid-19th-century notion that it was the United States' divine destiny to expand to the Pacific Ocean. With its abundant natural resources and useful ports, California presented a particularly appealing territory for annexation.</p>\r\n<p>Presidents as far back as Andrew Jackson had considered ways to take California, but it was James Polk who found a way to justify war. In April 1846, border skirmishes with Mexico in Texas gave Polk an excuse to put Manifest Destiny into action. The U.S.-Mexican War lasted less than a year and gave the United States undisputed control of California, Texas, Nevada, Utah, and parts of four other present-day states. California was now under American control. Its changes had only begun.</p>", "render_as": "H", "byline": "\"1821-1847: Missions, Ranchos, and the Mexican War for Independence\" was written by Joshua Paddison and the University of California in 2005 as part of the [California Cultures](/cal-cultures) project.", "byline_render_as": "M", "curator": "University of California", "copyright_year": 2011, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "go_further": "<h4>Online</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>National Parks Service.<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/5views/5views5.htm\"> History of Mexican Americans in California</a></p> \r\n\r\n<p>PBS.<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/\"> The U.S.-Mexican War</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>In the Library</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Francaviglia, Richard, and Douglas W.

Already a meeting place for Mexicans, Russians, Americans, Europeans, and natives, the gold rush turned California into a truly global frontier where immigrants from every continent on earth now jostled. More than 300,000 gold seekers flooded California by 1850, bringing to the new American state an astonishing variety of languages, religions, and social customs. Many of these visitors had no interest in settling down in California, intending only to make their \"pile\" and return home with pockets full of gold. The arrival and departure of thousands of immigrants, the intensely multicultural nature of society, and the newness of American institutions made Gold Rush California a chaotic, confusing landscape for natives and newcomers alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Native Population Plummets</h2>\r\n<p>The disruptions of the Gold Rush proved devastating for California's native groups, already in demographic decline due to Spanish and Mexican intrusion. The state's native population plummeted from about 150,000 in 1848 to 30,000 just 12 years later. As foreigners methodically mined, hunted, and logged native groups' most remote hiding places, natives began raiding mining camps for subsistence. This led to cycles of violence as American miners \u2014 supported by the state government \u2014 organized war parties and sometimes slaughtered entire native groups.</p>\r\n<p>The Act for the Government and Protection of Indians, passed by the state legislature in 1850, denied native Californians the right to testify in court and allowed white Americans and Californios to keep natives as indentured servants. \"I do not like the white man because he is a liar and a thief,\" Isidora Filomena de Solano, a Patwin-speaking woman from the Bay Area, told an interviewer in 1874. She echoed the sentiments of many native Californians struggling to preserve traditional ways in the midst of holocaust.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Californios Lose Power, Land, and Privilege</h2>\r\n<p>The imposition of American government in California reversed the fortunes of elite Californios, who slowly lost their power, authority, and land. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the US-Mexican War, had granted Californios full US citizenship and promised that their property would be \"inviolably respected.\" But the informality of Mexican land grants made legal claims difficult when miners, squatters, and homesteaders overran Californios' lands.</p>\r\n<p>Even when Californio families won legal title to their lands, many found themselves bankrupt from attorney's fees or taxes. The Peralta family lost all but 700 of their 49,000 acres in the East Bay to lawyers, taxes, squatters, and speculators. Eight Californios participated in the California constitutional convention of 1849, but over time their political power declined along with their land base.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>White Americans vs. \"Foreign Miners\"</h2>\r\n<p>Californios feared losing their privileged status and being lumped in with the thousands of Spanish-speaking immigrants from Mexico and other parts of Latin America who arrived in California during the Gold Rush. Mexicans and Chilenos were among the first foreigners to make it to California in 1848, and their proximity and mining expertise gave them an edge in the cutthroat competition of the mines.</p>\r\n<p>Their early success led the California legislature to adopt a foreign miners\u2019 license tax in 1850 aimed at \"greasers,\" as all Latin Americans were called. When Latin American miners refused to pay the impossibly high tax ($20 per month), white Americans had an excuse to drive them out of rich mining areas. In the mining town of Sonora, Mexicans, Chileans, and Peruvians joined with French and German miners to protest the tax, only to be subdued by a hastily formed militia of white Americans.</p>\r\n<p>Rumors began to spread throughout gold country about a swashbuckling Mexican bandit named Joaqu\u00edn Murieta who was striking back against American injustices. The California legislature offered a huge reward and in 1853 a Texan named Harry Love produced the head of someone he insisted was Murieta. Whether Joaqu\u00edn Murieta ever actually existed is unknown, but he was celebrated as a hero by many Latin Americans enraged by oppressive American policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Chinese Gold Seekers</h2>\r\n<p>Chinese gold seekers arrived in great numbers after 1851, and soon comprised about a fifth of the entire population in mining areas. Coming to the mines later than other groups, many Chinese immigrants earned a living by working claims abandoned by other miners. They also took jobs as cooks, launderers, merchants, and herbalists, hoping to return to China with a small fortune. However, low pay, discriminatory hiring practices, and the monthly foreign miners' license tax made this goal all but impossible.</p>\r\n<p>In the face of intense prejudice, some Chinese Californians challenged American racism through the legal system and in the court of public opinion. Chinese community leaders petitioned Sacramento to overturn unfair laws and worked to gain the right to testify in court (finally granted in 1872). Norman Asing, a restaurant owner in San Francisco's booming Chinatown, wrote to California governor John Bigler in 1852, insisting, \"We are not the degraded race you would make us.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>African Americans Look for Equality and Gold</h2>\r\n<p>More than 2,000 African Americans traveled to California by 1852, lured by reports that the California frontier offered a rough-and-tumble egalitarianism along with its gold deposits. Like most gold seekers, they were bitterly disappointed by what they found.</p>\r\n<p>California entered the United States as a free state in 1850, but the lack of government oversight allowed slavery to flourish in certain regions. The state legislature passed a fugitive slave law in 1852, making it illegal for enslaved African Americans to flee their masters within the state's supposedly free borders. All African Americans in California, born free or formerly enslaved, thereafter lived under a constant threat of arrest. They were also barred from testifying in court or sending their children to public schools.</p>\r\n<p>Mifflin Wistar Gibbs, an African American abolitionist who had spent years lecturing with Frederick Douglass, helped organize the First State Convention of Colored Citizens of California in 1855 to fight for suffrage and equal rights. African Americans won the right to testify in California in 1863 but the right to vote came only with the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cross-Cultural Cooperation</h2>\r\n<p>Although discrimination and violence were rampant, Gold Rush California was also a place of cross-cultural communication and cooperation. Canadian merchant William Perkins described the mining town of Sonora in 1849: \"Here were to be seen people of every nation in all varieties of costume, and speaking 50 different languages, and yet all mixing together amicably and socially.\" In mining camps and in the crowded streets of San Francisco, previously isolated groups came into contact for the first time. Race, language, religion, and class separated Californians but proximity forced groups to accommodate as well as compete. Multiracial even before it was a state, California would be continuously shaped by its diversity.</p>", "render_as": "H", "byline": "\"1848-1865: Gold Rush, Statehood, and the Western Movement\" was written by Joshua Paddison and the University of California in 2005 as part of the [California Cultures](/cal-cultures) project.", "byline_render_as": "M", "curator": "University of California", "copyright_year": 2011, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "go_further": "<h4>Online</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Bancroft Library. <a href=\"http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/Exhibits/Goldrush/introduction.html\"> The California Gold Rush</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oakland Museum of California. <a href=\"http://www.museumca.org/goldrush/\"> Gold Rush!: California\u2019s Untold Stories</a></p> \r\n<p>PBS. <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/goldrush/\"> The Gold Rush</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"cite\">The Sacramento Bee</span>. <a href=\"http://www.calgoldrush.com/\"> Gold Rush Sesquicentennial</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>In the Library</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson, Susan Lee. <span class=\"cite\">Roaring Camp: The Social World of the California Gold Rush.</span> New York: W.

The completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 vastly increased the pace of urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural development. The state's population exploded from 380,000 in 1860 to almost 3.5 million in 1920, largely due to swelling immigration from other parts of the United States as well as Latin America, Asia, and Europe. Pulled by dreams of economic success (as promised by state boosters), these migrants found both opportunity and hardship in modernizing California.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>New Wave of Chinese Immigration</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the many difficulties involved in completing the transcontinental railroad was the problem of finding laborers willing to take on the dangerous, back-breaking work. In 1865, the Central Pacific Railroad turned to Chinese workers, who soon comprised two-thirds of the railroad's labor force. Most of the approximately 10,000 Chinese railroad laborers came directly from China, joining thousands of their countrymen already in California from the Gold Rush era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many Chinese immigrants viewed California as a temporary stopover where they hoped to earn enough money to return to their hometowns wealthy and successful. A song from San Francisco's Chinatown expressed this desire: \"I am returning home with purses and bags stuffed full. Soon I will see my parents' brows beaming with joy.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This wish to return home also reflected the discrimination and outright violence Chinese Californians faced. An economic downturn during the 1870s heightened job competition and encouraged anti-Chinese xenophobia. So-called \"anti-coolie clubs\" formed throughout the state to denounce Chinese immigration. White mobs attacked Chinese communities up and down California, climaxing in an all-out assault on San Francisco's Chinatown in 1877.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The largely Irish Workingmen's Party, organized in San Francisco by Denis Kearney, blamed the Chinese for unemployment, low wages, and poor working conditions. California politicians buckled to this mounting pressure and helped pass a federal ban on Chinese immigration in 1882, the first such law in US history. With immigration from China cut off until World War II, those Chinese already in California became increasingly marginalized. They struggled to maintain dignity and financial stability in the face of racist boycotts, discriminatory hiring practices, and threats of mob violence.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>Booming Agriculture, Migrant Labor</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>California's booming agricultural economy created an endless need for farm labor. Although family farming was typical in the Midwest, California agriculture was dominated by large-scale industrial farming, and huge numbers of migratory workers were hired and fired each year. A succession of ethnic groups provided this labor, beginning with Native Americans in the 1850s and 1860s, followed by Chinese, Japanese, Hindustanis, Filipinos, and Mexicans.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Excluded from the American Federation of Labor (AFL) due to their race and \"unskilled\" status, agricultural workers suffered the worst conditions of any labor sector in California. They commonly worked 16-hour days in the merciless sun for extremely low wages while living in unsanitary temporary camps. In 1903, 1,500 Japanese and Mexican sugar beet harvesters in Oxnard staged California's first recorded agricultural strike. It lasted two months and won the workers a pay hike, but the new union dissolved after the AFL refused to recognize it. Though dubbed California's \"peculiar institution\" for its similarities to southern slavery, exploitative migratory farm labor remained widespread throughout the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hispanic Americans</h2>\r\n<p>The Mexican immigrants who increasingly dominated agricultural labor in California after 1900 took on the brutal work because farm jobs were often the only ones available to them. Dislocations caused by the Mexican Revolution propelled many Mexicans northward, but once in California these immigrants encountered rampant discrimination. Middle- and upper-class Mexican men and women could often only find work as day laborers, farm workers, and maids. Mexican Californians tended to live in segregated enclaves where constant in-migration invigorated Mexican culture, traditions, and language. In urban barrios and rural colonias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexican Californians blended old and new practices just as they made use of both Spanish and English, forging entirely new identities as Mexican Americans. The reality of their severe economic circumstances flew in the face of the popular celebration of California's Spanish past that flourished in the early 20th century. Even as Californians romanticized their state's 19th-century Mexican heritage, most turned a blind eye to the day-to-day problems faced by Mexican Californians in the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Native Californians</h2>\r\n<p>California Indians found themselves in a similarly dispiriting position \u2014 celebrated in the popular imagination while their ongoing plight remained generally ignored. The Native Californian population reached its nadir in 1900 at less than 20,000, the low point of a horrifying demographic decline due to disease, malnourishment, and violence. Less than half lived on reservations \u2014 most found work in California cities or in migratory agriculture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reformers such as Helen Hunt Jackson struggled to raise public awareness of Indian poverty and to dispel myths of the permanently \"vanishing Indian.\" Most reformers encouraged native Californians to assimilate into white society for survival, forcing Indians to make difficult choices about how to best maintain traditional ways. A native man named Ishi \u2014 believed to be the last survivor of his group, the Yahi \u2014 allowed University of California anthropologists to study and interview him during the 1910s. Ishi's obvious resiliency and intelligence challenged popular racist stereotypes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The early 20th century also saw Native Californians employing the legal system to fight for land rights, educational opportunities, and citizenship rights. In 1917, the California Supreme Court awarded Native Californians the right to vote, paving the way for the 1924 Indian Citizenship Act granting full citizenship. After the low point of 1900, California's Indian population slowly began to increase as native communities adapted old ways to new circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>African Americans</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>African Americans made up less than 2 percent of California's population in the decades before World War I. Numbering about 7,800 in 1900, black Californians maintained a sense of community through memberships in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Urban League, and the California Association of Colored Women\u2019s Clubs. African Americans lived mostly in California\u2019s growing urban centers where racial discrimination often relegated them to low-paying jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some black entrepreneurs \u2014 including several notable women \u2014 managed to find financial success through hard work and good fortune. Former slave Biddy Mason used the money she earned as a nurse to invest in Los Angeles real estate, becoming a wealthy philanthropist. Mary Ellen Pleasant, another former slave, ran several businesses and restaurants in San Francisco and used her resources to fight for African-American civil rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A Widening Gulf</h2>\r\n<p>In the years between 1865 and 1920, California's booming international population adapted to a newly industrialized, urbanized landscape. Economic inequality ran rampant as the gulf between rich and poor became a chasm. Racial discrimination and segregation belied the California dream of prosperity and equal opportunity for all. But California remained a desirable destination for thousands of immigrants who were willing to cope with challenging circumstances. They struggled to make the California dream a reality for their family and community.</p>", "render_as": "H", "byline": "\"1866-1920: Rapid Population Growth, Large-Scale Agriculture, and Integration into the United States\" was written by Joshua Paddison and the University of California in 2005 as part of the [California Cultures](/cal-cultures) project.", "byline_render_as": "M", "curator": "University of California", "copyright_year": 2011, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "go_further": "<h4>Online</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>CSU Northridge.<a href=\"http://digital-library.csun.edu/SFV/\"> San Fernando Valley History Digital Library</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Library of Congress.<a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/cbhtml/cbhome.html\"> California as I Saw It: First-Person Narratives of California\u2019s Early Years, 1849-1900</a></p> \r\n\r\n<h4>In the Library</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Almaguer, Tom\u00e1s. <span class=\"cite\">Racial Fault Lines: The Historical Origins of White Supremacy in California.</span> Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Haas, Lisbeth. <span class=\"cite\">Conquests and Historical Identities in California, 1769-1936.</span> Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guti\u00e9rrez, David G. <span class=\"cite\">Walls and Mirrors: Mexican Americans, Mexican Immigrants, and the Politics of Ethnicity.</span> Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995.</p>", "go_further_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.historicalessay", "pk": 7, "fields": {"title": "1921-present: Modern California - Migration, Technology, Cities", "slug": "modern-california", "hero": "d5d98b3163cbfb1385f9d5a61b508ca9", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/ft3w1004dt", "hero_first": true, "blockquote": "", "essay": "<p>Over the course of the 20th century, California grew at a rate surpassing even state boosters' most breathless predictions.

Throughout the 20th century, California's millions of Native Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans strove for economic security, political equality, and social change.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Native Americans</h2>\r\n<p>The number of Native Americans living in California rose steadily after 1900, reversing the appalling decline of the previous century. Much of this increase was a result of federal job training and relocation programs that encouraged Indians from other states to move to California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1965, fewer than 10 percent of the state\u2019s 75,000 Native Americans lived on rural reservations. Those who did comprised California\u2019s most disadvantaged group, with higher unemployment rates than any other minority. Urban Indians fared better but still experienced limited educational and employment opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beginning in the 1960s, Native Americans in California formed pan-Indian organizations such as the American Indian Historical Society, California Rural Indian Health Board, and California Indian Education Association to advocate for native rights. A group of activists called Indians of All Tribes occupied Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay from 1969 to 1971, part of a nationwide Native American social justice movement that continues today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1980s, the Cabazon and Morongo Bands of Mission Indians began offering card games and bingo on their reservations, setting off a controversy over gaming that would culminate in a 1987 US Supreme Court decision affirming Native Americans' right to build casinos on reservation lands. By 2005, there were 55 Native American casinos in California bringing in a total annual income of more than $3.5 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These revenues have dramatically changed the economic, political, and social landscapes of California's native peoples. Because only groups that have been federally recognized as official tribes can build casinos, an enormous financial gulf now separates recognized and unrecognized native groups. Those groups with federal recognition enjoy considerable political clout, while members of unrecognized groups continue to suffer from joblessness, under-education, and poor living conditions. Money from gaming has also generated controversies over Indian identity as federally recognized groups have been forced to reconsider who can and cannot claim membership. Gaming has brought new wealth to some of California's Native Americans, but it has also brought new divisions, contentions, and self-definitions.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>African Americans</h2>\r\n<p>African Americans first moved to California in large numbers during World War II to work in shipping and other war industries. Chester Himes's 1945 novel <span class=\"cite\">If He Hollers Let Him Go,</span> set in wartime Los Angeles, exposed the racial discrimination many black migrants faced in their new home. Racist real estate policies limited African Americans' ability to move out of segregated urban neighborhoods, and discrimination restricted their access to skilled and professional jobs as well as higher education.</p>  \r\n<p>In 1965, anger and desperation turned into violence in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts, triggered by rumors of police brutality. The violence in Watts \u2014 the most destructive urban uprising in US history at that time \u2014 lasted a week, involved more than 10,000 Los Angelinos, and left at least 34 people dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The underlying causes of the Watts uprising \u2014 including underemployment, poverty, segregation, and police harassment \u2014 persisted almost 30 years later. In 1992, violence erupted again in south central Los Angeles after the acquittal of several white police officers for the beating of motorist Rodney King. This reoccurrence of urban violence surprised many who believed the Civil Rights movement had improved conditions for California's African Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s did see the emergence of a sizeable black middle class in the state, a result of activism, entrepreneurship, and government programs. A number of African American politicians won important offices, including Thomas Bradley (five-term mayor of Los Angeles), Willie L. Brown, Jr. (two-term mayor of San Francisco), and US representatives Augustus Hawkins, Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, Ronald Dellums, Julian Carey Dixon, Mervyn Dymally, Barbara Lee, Juanita Millender-McDonald, and Maxine Waters. Ironically, as upwardly mobile African Americans have moved from the urban centers of Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco into suburbs and the Central Valley, their ability to elect black politicians has actually weakened. Their voting bloc has scattered, while Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans have grown in numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Asian Americans</h2>\r\n<p>California's Asian American population remained small until 1965, when federal officials changed immigration policy to allow migration from Asia after 40 years of exclusion. In the decades before 1965, those Asian immigrants in California were considered \"aliens\" and barred from citizenship due to their race. Furthermore, a 1913 state law forbade Japanese Americans from owning land or leasing it for more than three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the federal government rounded up and relocated 93,000 Californians of Japanese descent in the name of national security. Most were confined to relocation camps for more than two years despite never being convicted \u2014 or even formally accused \u2014 of a crime. Once released, many Japanese Americans found themselves destitute, stripped of their houses and possessions. Recognizing the injustice of the relocation campaigns, the US Congress made partial reparations to Japanese Americans in 1948 and again in 1988. But the stigma of being labeled national enemies simply because of their race lingered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 1965, immigration to the United States from Asia and the Pacific skyrocketed, with California as the prime destination. By 1990, 40 percent of all Asian Americans in the country lived in California, numbering about 3 million. California became home to thriving immigrant communities from China, Japan, the Philippines, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Pacific islands. Asian Americans most heavily concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, with large numbers also living in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Fresno, Sutter, Yuba, and Sacramento counties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to 2000 census data, a higher percentage of Asian Americans went to college than any other California group; but their per capita income still lagged significantly behind that of whites ($22,000 versus $31,700), revealing the persistence of anti-Asian prejudice in hiring. The growing political strength of Asian Americans has only begun to be exercised, thus far manifested in the elections of S. I. Hayakawa, Robert Matsui, and Norman Mineta to the US Congress, and Matt Fong as California State Treasurer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hispanic Americans</h2>\r\n<p>The largest minority group in California during the 20th century was Hispanic Americans, most prominently Mexican Americans. One-half million Mexicans migrated to the United States during the 1920s, with more than 30 percent settling in California. Mexican Americans soon made up the bulk of the labor force in many unskilled and semi-skilled industries, including agriculture, railroads, manufacturing, and domestic service. Many immigrants lived in segregated urban <span class=\"cite\">barrios,</span> such as east Los Angeles, where they forged new identities as Mexican Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two incidents in Los Angeles during World War II revealed the city\u2019s rampant anti-Mexican prejudice. In January 1943, 17 Mexican American youths were convicted of murdering a boy whose body had been found in a reservoir known as Sleepy Lagoon. The racist bias of the judge and prosecution was so blatant that the Sleepy Lagoon case attracted the sympathy of people around the country before being overturned by an appellate court. Meanwhile, long-simmering tensions between white servicemen and Mexican American \"zoot suiters\" (so named for their jaunty clothes) turned into a week-long race riot in June 1943. Mobs of white sailors, soldiers, and marines assaulted Mexican-American teenagers and tore off their clothes, but local newspapers portrayed the boys as the aggressors. Even the name of the incident \u2014 the Zoot Suit Riots \u2014 placed the blame on Mexican Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the decades after World War II, Latinos in California grew in numbers and political strength. In 1966, C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez and Dolores Huerta helped found the United Farm Workers, a labor union aimed at organizing migrant farm workers \u2014 mostly Mexican Americans \u2014 who had for decades endured perilous working conditions, low pay, and no job security. The labor activism of Ch\u00e1vez and Huerta comprised one arm of the La Raza movement, which endeavored to expose and overturn the discrimination in employment, housing, and education that Hispanic Americans faced in California. The La Raza movement included muralists, poets, entrepreneurs, politicians, and labor organizers within its ranks, and descendants of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and other parts of Latin America in addition to Mexico.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Despite this tradition of activism, Hispanic Californians have had trouble winning public office. But the recent elections of Cruz Bustamante (Lieutenant Governor) and Antonio Villaraigosa (Los Angeles mayor) suggest the arrival of a powerful political presence. Ongoing controversies over illegal immigration and bilingual education have mobilized California's Hispanic population even as they exposed internal class and cultural divisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Multicultural California</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2000 census produced a snapshot of California today. The state is more multicultural than ever before, with 32 percent Hispanic Americans, 11 percent Asian Americans, 6.7 percent African Americans, and 1 percent Native Americans (330,657, more than any other state). A full 26 percent of Californians were born outside the United States, and 39.5 percent of adults reported that they spoke a language other than English at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the first time, census respondents were allowed to mark more than one race to identify themselves, and more than 1.5 million Californians did so, a small sign of the blending of cultures that has marked California for centuries. Though riven by fault lines and marred by continuing inequality, California continues to symbolize opportunity and hope for millions. It is a product of the interwoven histories and cultures of its diverse peoples.</p>", "render_as": "H", "byline": "\"1921-present: Modern California - Migration, Technology, Cities\" was written by Joshua Paddison and the University of California in 2005 as part of the [California Cultures](/cal-cultures) project.", "byline_render_as": "M", "curator": "University of California", "copyright_year": 2011, "copyright_holder": "Regents of the University of California", "go_further": "<h4>Online</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.caamuseum.org/\"> California African American Museum</a></p>\r\n\r\n<!--<p>Calisphere,<a href=\"http://jarda.cdlib.org/\"> Japanese American Relocation Digital Archives</a></p>  -->\r\n\r\n<p>The Bancroft Library.<a href=\"http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt5p3019m2/\"> Chinese in California virtual collection</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oakland Museum of California.<a href=\"http://www.museumca.org/LHP/\"> Latino History Project</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>In the Library</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>de Graaf, Lawrence B., Kevin Mulroy, and Quintard Taylor, eds. <span class=\"cite\">Seeking El Dorado: African Americans in California.</span> Los Angeles: Autry Museum of Western Heritage, 2001</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Phillips, George Harwood. <span class=\"cite\">The Enduring Struggle: Indians in California History.</span> San Francisco: Boyd &amp; Fraser, 1981.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>S\u00e1nchez, George J. <span class=\"cite\">Becoming Mexican American: Ethnicity, Culture, and Identity in Chicano Los Angeles, 1900-1945.</span> New York: Oxford University Press, 1995.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yoo, David K. <span class=\"cite\">Growing Up Nisei: Race, Generation, and Culture among Japanese Americans of California, 1924-49.</span> Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yung, Judy. <span class=\"cite\">Unbound Feet: A Social History of Chinese Women in San Francisco.</span> Berkeley: University of California, 1995.</p>", "go_further_render_as": "H", "publish": true, "color": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_keywords": ""}}, {"model": "exhibits.historicalessay", "pk": 8, "fields": {"title": "Relocation and Incarceration of Japanese Americans During World War II", "slug": "relocation", "hero": "e9050617dad4665701b224e24d86eacf", "lockup_derivative": "", "alternate_lockup_derivative": "", "item_id": "ark:/13030/ft1x0nb06g", "hero_first": true, "blockquote": "", "essay": "<p>On December 7, 1941, Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. The next day, the United States and Britain declared war on Japan. Two months later, on February 19, 1942, the lives of thousands of Japanese Americans were dramatically changed when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 (<a href=\"http://www.ourdocuments.gov/print_friendly.php?page=transcript&doc=74&title=Transcript+of+Executive+Order+9066:++Resulting+in+the+Relocation+of+Japanese+(1942)\">view the Order</a>). This order led to the assembly and evacuation and relocation of nearly 122,000 men, women, and children of Japanese ancestry on the west coast of the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Racism and Prejudice</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is interesting to note that, despite the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Japanese Americans in Hawaii were not incarcerated en masse. Of the total Japanese American population in Hawaii-which made up \r\nnearly 40% of the population of Hawaii itself, and a large portion of the skilled workforce-only a few thousand people were detained. The fact that so few Japanese Americans were  incarcerated in \r\nHawaii suggests that their mass removal on the West Coast was racially motivated rather than born of \"military necessity.\" Agricultural interest groups in western states and many local politicians had \r\nlong been opposed to the presence of Japanese Americans and used the attack on Pearl Harbor to step up calls for their removal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States was fighting the war on three fronts \u2014 Japan, Germany, and Italy \u2014 compared to the number of Japanese Americans, a relatively small number of Germans and Italians were interned in the United States. But although Executive Order 9066 was written in vague terms that did not specify an ethnicity, it was used for the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans. The government claimed that incarceration was for military necessity and, ironically, to \"protect\" Japanese Americans from racist retribution they might face as a result of Pearl Harbor. (These reasons were later proved false by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians in the 1980s.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Japanese Americans and other Asian Americans had long been characterized as a foreign \"Yellow Peril\" that was a threat to the United States. Prejudice against Japanese Americans, including laws preventing them from owning land, existed long before World War II. Even though Japanese Americans largely considered themselves loyal and even patriotic Americans, suspicions about their loyalties were pervasive. Before Pearl Harbor was bombed, President Roosevelt secretly commissioned Curtis Munson, a businessman, to assess the possibility that Japanese Americans would pose a threat to US security. Munson\u2019s report found (as cited in Ronald Takaki, <span class=\"cite\">Strangers from a Distant Shore,</span> page 386) that \"There will be no armed uprising of Japanese\" in the United States. \"For the most part,\" the report says, \"the local Japanese are loyal to the United States or, at worst, hope that by remaining quiet they can avoid concentration camps or irresponsible mobs.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite these findings, however, thousands of families in California, Oregon, and Washington were soon incarcerated in government camps. The government \u2014 and popular sentiment \u2014 understood that German Americans were not necessarily Nazi sympathizers, and could distinguish Italian Americans from Mussolini\u2019s Fascist regime, but they had a more difficult time separating Japanese Americans from Imperial Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of those interned \u2014 nearly 70,000, over 60% \u2014 were American citizens.  Many of the rest were long-time US residents who had lived in this country between 20 and 40 years. By and large, most Japanese Americans, particularly the Nisei (the first generation born in the United States), considered themselves loyal Americans. No Japanese American or Japanese national was ever found guilty of sabotage or espionage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Camps</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>From March 1942 to 1946, the US War Relocation Authority (WRA) had jurisdiction over the Japanese and Japanese Americans evacuated from their homes in California, Oregon, and Washington. It administered the extensive resettlement program, and oversaw the details of the registration and segregation programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Evacuated\" families left behind homes, businesses, pets, land, and most of their belongings. Taking only what they could carry, Japanese Americans were taken by bus and train to assembly centers \u2014 hastily converted facilities such as race tracks and fairgrounds. Here they awaited reassignment to the \"relocation camps.\"</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The WRA controlled the administration of 10 camps in remote areas of California, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Texas, and Arkansas. Although official government photographs were careful not to show it, these facilities were fenced with barbed wire and guarded by armed soldiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During internment (also called incarceration), families worked, studied, and lived their lives in the barracks-like living quarters of the relocation centers, which were alternately labeled \"relocation camps,\" \"concentration camps,\" or \"evacuation centers.\" These camps, some of which housed approximately 8,000 people, functioned as communities. The government provided medical care, schools, and food, and adults often held camp jobs \u2014 in food service, agriculture, medical clinics, as teachers, and other jobs required for daily life.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>Postwar \"Resettlement\"</h2> \r\n\r\n<p>In December 1944, President Roosevelt rescinded Executive Order 9066, and the WRA began a six-month process of releasing internees (often to \"resettlement\" facilities and temporary housing) and shutting down the camps. In August 1945, the war was over. By 1946, the camps were closed and all of the internees had been released to rebuild their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the postwar years, these Japanese Americans had to rebuild their lives. The US citizens and long-time residents who had been incarcerated had lost their personal liberties, and many also lost their homes, businesses, property, and savings. Individuals born in Japan were not allowed to become naturalized US citizens until 1952.</p>\r\n\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\ntd { border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px; }\r\n.left { width: 140px; vertical-align: top; font-weight: bold; }\r\n</style>  \r\n\r\n <h2>Chronology of World War II and Japanese American Incarceration</h2>\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"left\">December 7, 1941</td>\r\n    <td class=\"right\">Japan bombs Pearl Harbor.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"left\">December 8, 1941</td>\r\n    <td class=\"right\">United States and Britain declare war on Japan.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"left\">February 19, 1942</td>\r\n    <td class=\"right\">President Roosevelt signs Executive Order 9066.
